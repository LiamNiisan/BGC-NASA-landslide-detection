CORTEZ, Colo. — A pair of massive boulders rolled off a Colorado mountainside and smashed into a highway, destroying the pavement and leaving a house-sized rock across the roadway that will have to be blasted apart, state transportation officials said Saturday.

The highway is closed indefinitely, according to the San Miguel Sheriff, as crews removed unstable and loose rock to prevent another fall.

A photo posted by the City of Ouray showed a person posing in front of one of the boulders, which appeared as big as a two-story house. The other large boulder carved an 8-foot trench as it went over the roadway.

It’s relatively common for boulders and smaller rocks to fall on mountain highways, particularly in spring after the repeated melting and freezing of snow and ice creates new fissures on mountainsides.

But Friday’s afternoon rock slide along state Highway 145 between Cortez and Telluride was unusual in that it began about 1,000 feet above the highway , in a cliff band at the top of a slope leading down to the highway.

Once the slope above is deemed safe, crews will seek to build a shoulder along the damaged roadway so at least a single lane of traffic can be opened, Schwantes said."	pos

The Big Bar rockslide, which officials believe occurred in late October or early November 2018, is located in the Fraser River just north of the town of Lillooet in northern British Columbia. Because of the remoteness of the location, the slide was not discovered until late June 2019.

It created a waterfall which is preventing millions of chinook, steelhead, coho and sockeye salmon from swimming upstream to their habitual spawning grounds.

The provincial and federal governments are now working with local First Nations communities to move the salmon manually upstream, by creating holding ponds that will allow them to transport the fish via helicopter to a site further upstream.

“Collaborative efforts like this one, with all partners ... are crucial and will give the best chance of survival to these stocks,” Jonathan Wilkinson, federal minister of fisheries and oceans, said in a statement on Friday.

Other fish movement options being enacted are physically moving rocks from the slide to create a series of natural pools for the fish to rest in, and a fish transportation system of flexible pressurized tubes, the provincial government has said.

The fish will be monitored on their journey, including through blood samples taken to assess their energy reserves once they have passed the obstruction.

As the bodies of 59 people, who were buried alive in the landslide, are being retrieved one after the other since last Friday, their post-mortem is being conducted in the building of a nearby mosque. Masjid Al-Mujahidin mosque at Pothukal has opened its doors to the dead — to Hindus, Muslims and Christians. The mosque committee has handed over its premises used by women to offer namaz for conducting post-mortem of the victims.

Tying together writing tables at the madrasa, post-mortem tables have been readied. Since last Friday, the final journey of the victims, irrespective of their religion, has started from the compound of this mosque.

Pothukal panchayat member Sulaiman Haji said the nearest government hospital where post-mortem is conducted is in Nilambur, about 25 km from the village. “After the landslide and flood, it was very difficult to take all bodies to Nilambur. When officials wanted a place for post-mortem, we approached the mosque committee and they readily handed over its premises.’’

Mosque committee secretary Kareem Kavanaseri said, “Humanity is above everything, including religion. When officials sought for a place to conduct post-mortem, I showed them a room attached to the mosque. After a day, the doctors sought more space. Then we decided to hand over the halls where women offer namaz. We have also provided the facility for cleaning the bodies after they are retrieved,” said Kareem, who is also a trader.

The post-mortem proceedings also continued on Monday, when Eid was observed. Kareem said no one in the community had objected to the gesture. “In this hour of crisis, we can’t think anything else,’’ he said. The mosque is managed by Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen."	pos

Two others died in a landslide in Baglung in the northwest.

Both landslides struck the villages before dawn and people could not escape to safety, rescuers said.

“Rescuers are looking for those who are missing,” Wasti told Reuters.

A stretch of Highway 1 was closed Wednesday morning due to downed power lines, with no detour available.

At about 6:40 a.m. Wednesday, DriveBC posted to social media that the Trans-Canada Highway was closed two kilometres south of Hells Gate Tunnel.

""Crews are on scene, assessment in progress,"" the post said. ""No detour available, no estimated time of reopening.""

When details were first announced about the closure, DriveBC said it was due to a mudslide. However, in a correction posted about an hour later, DriveBC said the route was actually closed because of downed power lines.

The closure is about 15 kilometres south of Boston Bar.

Southern B.C.'s highways have faced several closures in recent weeks after multiple atmospheric rivers hit the region last month bringing record-breaking rainfall, catastrophic flooding and multiple landslides including one that was fatal.

At the peak of the storms, there were no available routes between the Lower Mainland and the Interior. But over the past few weeks, crews have worked to repair and reopen roads.

As recently as this week, Highway 11 connecting Abbotsford and Mission reopened and travel restrictions on Highway 7 lifted.

Even so, restrictions remain in effect on a number of other routes, including Highway 99 and Highway 3. Fleming said there are no immediate plans to fully reopen either of those two major highways, describing Highway 3 as ""crucial"" to the province's supply chain."	neg

(WSPA) — North Carolina Department of Transportation announced Saturday that part of Interstate 40 in the mountains will remain closed for a week following a mudslide.

The slide happened Friday evening at mile marker 7.5 near the Tennessee state line.

UPDATE: Rockslide will keep I-40 in NC mountains closed until Saturday, officials say

“For everybody’s safety — drivers, workers, contractors — we need to keep the road closed for about a week,” Division 14 Engineer Brian Burch said. “At that point, we anticipate having enough material down the mountain that we can restore one lane of traffic in each direction.”

Traffic will be limited to one lane in each direction, on the eastbound side of a concrete median, for six to eight weeks, according to the release.

NC DOT said geotechnical experts surveyed the mountainside Saturday morning to find that debris was still falling.

The engineers determined that work will be required to stabilize the 500-foot wide area near Hurricane Creek.

UPDATE: Rockslide will keep I-40 in NC mountains closed until Saturday, officials say

According to a release, NC DOT awarded an emergency contract to Harrison Construction as part of another contract to improve I-40 later on this spring.

“Preliminary plans include removing approximately 27,000 cubic yards of dirt, rock and other debris, followed by the installation of preventative measures such as a netting or catchment fence. GeoTechnical experts will help develop the detailed plans,” NCDOT said in a release.

Drivers will need to plan for extra travel time.

NCDOT said the detour that utilizes a combination of I-40, I-240, I-26, and I-81 through Asheville and Johnson City is about 50 miles longer than driving through the Pigeon River Gorge.

BAY ISMOYO/Getty

Jakarta — Indonesian rescuers mounted a desperate search Friday for those missing after flash floods and landslides sparked by torrential rains killed at least 43 people across the Jakarta region. Health authorities were racing to prevent disease outbreaks.

Around a dozen people were still unaccounted for after record rains that started on New Year's Eve pounded the capital and left swathes of the megalopolis, home to some 30 million, under water and thousands homeless.

Around 192,000 residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters, according to authorities, with many unable to return to waterlogged homes in neighborhoods turned into wastelands of debris and overturned cars.

""We're encouraging people whose houses are still inundated to go to a safer place,"" said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo.

The agency said 43 people had been confirmed dead in Greater Jakarta and neighboring Lebak regency in the south of Java island.

Waters had receded in many areas and power, which had been shut off across many districts, was being restored.

In hard-hit Bekasi, on the outskirts of the city, swampy streets were littered with debris and crushed cars lying on top of each other — with waterline marks reaching as high as buildings' second floors.

The government said Friday it would start cloud seeding to the west of the capital — inducing rain using chemicals sprayed from planes — to prevent approaching rainfall from pounding the region.

Using inflatable boats to evacuate residents trapped in their homes, including children and seniors, rescuers said they were targeting the hardest-hit areas of the city on Friday.

Shelters filled up with many refugees, including infants, resting on thin mats as food and drinking water ran low.

""It's impossible for me to go back to my home,"" said 72-year-old Lumongga Siregar.

""We have no clean water right now ... and we're hoping for more food because there isn't much,"" she added.

Mother Dewi Puspitasari worried about her one-year-old daughter's health.

""The blanket and mat I've got here aren't thick enough for her and we're scared she will get sick,"" she told AFP.

Indonesia's health ministry said it deployed some 11,000 health workers and soldiers to distribute medicine, disinfectant hygiene kits and food in a bid to stave off outbreaks of Hepatitis A, mosquito-borne Dengue fever and other illnesses, including infections linked to contact with dead animals.

In hard-hit Lebak outside Jakarta, residents started the slow process of cleaning up their deluged homes.

""Everything's gone,"" said shop owner Aminah, who goes by one name.

""I couldn't bring anything ... I left it all because I got scared at how high the water was getting.""

Most services in Jakarta have been restored although some commuter train lines were still suspended Friday.

Jakarta is regularly hit by floods during the rainy season, which started in late November.

But this week's disaster marked Jakarta's worst flooding since 2013 when dozens were killed after the city was inundated by monsoon rains.

""This year's flooding was phenomenally bad because of the extremely high rainfall,"" said Yayat Supriatna, a Jakarta-based urban planning expert.

But Jakarta's myriad infrastructure problems, including poor drainage and rampant overdevelopment, worsened the situation, he added.

""Yes, the weather conditions were terrible, but this was exacerbated by awful urban planning,"" Supriatna said.

Here's the latest news on the road.

For the second time this year, a landslide after heavy rains prompted officials to close part of Interstate 40 near the Tennessee-North Carolina state line.

This slide, however, was much smaller than the last, said David Uchiyama, spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Transportation.

Crews responding to the rockslide early Monday afternoon shut down both westbound lanes of I-40 at mile marker 7.5 in Haywood County, North Carolina, after finding three boulders in a ditch beside the road and several more on the mountainside that could pose a danger to motorists, Uchiyama said.

By 5:30 p.m., workers had moved the rocks, and one westbound lane had reopened.

""Traffic sitting in that queue will be allowed through, then traffic stopped at exit 20 will be allowed through,"" Uchiyama said. ""It will remain in a one-lane pattern overnight.""

Experts plan to visit the site Tuesday morning to help determine when the second lane can reopen.

The rockslide follows a much larger landslide in late February, which occurred in the same area and stopped all traffic on I-40 near the state line. The interstate reopened after six days, but traffic was restricted to one lane in each direction for several weeks as crews worked to clear more than 10,000 tons of debris.

After that landslide, workers installed rock anchors and wire mesh along the route, built a retaining wall, resurfaced the road and poured a new concrete median.

As of June 11, at least 13 people have died, two are still missing, and approximately 230 000 have been displaced.

Among the provinces affected are Guangdong, Guangxi– where six deaths and one missing were reported, and Hunan– where seven were known to have died with one person still missing.

Heavy rains ravaged 10 700 ha (26 400 acres) of crops and more than 2 800 houses in the mountainous province.

The country's Minister of Emergency Management confirmed Thursday, June 11, that about 228 000 people so far have been forced from their homes.

Aerial photos posted by state-owned Xinhua news agency showed parts of the city of Guilin submerged in muddy floodwater.

Footage uploaded by People's Daily China caught the terrifying moment a mudslide sent a residential building sliding into a flooded river. The media said all residents had been evacuated.

In Yangshuo, a famous tourist spot known for its karst mountains and river sights, streets were inundated after a flash flood, forcing residents and tourists to seek safety on bamboo rafts.

The county government reported that more than 1 000 hotels and family inns, as well as 5 000 shops, have been affected. More than 30 tourist sites were also damaged.

""Our losses are estimated at 3 million yuan (400 000 dollars), but it's a relief that none of our guests were harmed,"" said Zhang Ting, a family inn owner.

Continuous torrential rain triggered the burst of Lijiang River, with its peak water level hitting about 147 m (482 feet), surpassing the warning line. Officials added that 110 rivers in eight regions also swelled to the above-flood stage.

Luodian recorded 124 mm (5 inches) of rain in a 24-hour period to June 8, Ganzhou city saw 98 mm of rain (4 inches), while Sensui in eastern Guizhou recorded 91 mm (4 inches) the following day. In 24 hours to June 10, Yichang registered 148 mm (6 inches) of rain and Wuhan 140 mm (5 inches).

(Bob Hallinen / ADN archive)

DENALI NATIONAL PARK — Road crews have cleared one lane in Alaska’s Denali National Park and Preserve, and buses returned about 300 stranded tourists to the park entrance safely.

The tourists became stranded Friday after heavy rains triggered mudslides and caused excess water from a culvert to damage the only road inside the vast park.

Park spokesman Paul Ollig told The Associated Press that all the stranded passengers were back at the park entrance by midnight.

""Our team did an outstanding job responding to multiple debris slides along a pretty remote section of road,"" said Erika Jostad, Denali's chief ranger. ""The geohazard team monitored conditions while the road crew was clearing debris. It was a great example of teamwork.""

On Saturday, the park announced that the road will be fully open at 5 a.m. Sunday.

""Park staff have done a remarkable job responding to this incident and ensuring the safety and comfort of park visitors,"" Jostad said. ""Folks from all disciplines have come together to safely accomplish this important task.""

Earlier Friday, Denali’s superintendent closed Denali Park Road to all traffic at Mile 30.

Similar debris flows led to daylong traffic restrictions last week. Continued heavy rains since kept the road and surrounding tundra saturated with water.

Also on Friday, the Alaska Railroad said in a release that it has halted service north of the park because heavy rainfall had caused erosion below a retaining wall.

Passenger and freight service will be suspended through the area until late Monday at the earliest, the railroad said in a statement.

The railroad added that passengers traveling north to or south from Denali Park on the Alaska Railroad or on an Alaska Railroad provided service through Holland America/Princess or Premier Alaska Tours should expect delays."	pos

Firemen and rescuers in Camogli, a cliff-side village near the northern city of Genoa, scrambled to rescue the coffins, many of which were damaged or destroyed after falling on the rocks about 50 metres below the cemetery.

Only a dozen coffins out of the more than 200 swept away had been recovered as of Tuesday afternoon.

Images of open and partially destroyed coffins floating in Camogli’s green waters were published by most Italian media and were shared widely on social media.

The landslide appears to have been caused by coastal erosion, aggravated by severe storms that hit the northern Liguria region in recent years. It also destroyed two chapels at the Camogli cemetery.

Genoa prosecutors have opened an investigation into the disaster, examining recent building works in the area, which they say could have played a role in the landslide.

Local news reports suggested that the slope at Camogli had started to suffer from instability problems after a major storm in 2018. Works to mitigate the instability on parts of the cliff are ongoing.

Families who lost their relatives' remains at sea will be offered support, Camogli's mayor said.

“We’ll do our best to identify the bodies also using DNA tests,” said Francesco Olivari. “We are also planning to create a team that would provide psychological support to those people, who are understandably under shock.”"	pos

The woman’s husband had narrowly escaped the sudden mudslide on Friday, and his mother's body was recovered on Monday.

news Kerala Rains

The tragic stories of helpless families caught in the midst of Nature's fury continue to pour in from Kerala. On Sunday, as rescuers cleared the debris of a landslide in Malappuram, which had been captured on CCTV earlier in the week, they recovered bodies of a mother and child, with the parent still holding on protectively to her young son.

The mother, Geetha, was 21 while her son, Dhruvan, was just 1.5 years old. Till the last minute, it appears that Geetha had tried to keep her child away from harm, but it was not to be.

The lone survivor from the family is Sharath, Geetha's husband. He's the man in the CCTV visuals, who runs even as a landslide threatened to bury him alive. Just seconds before, his mother Sarojini had warned him. The mudslide took her over and her body was recovered on Monday.

Police officials told TNM that the mission to retrieve the bodies of the mother and the son was a tough one. ""The slabs were standing precariously and a wrong move would have made everything crash on them again. She was holding him. We had to remove her hold on the child and then remove the two bodies seperately,"" a police officer told TNM.

The landslide happened two days after heavy rains were wreaking havoc in the state.

The man – later identified as Sarath – was walking on a path talking to his mother, when a sudden mudslide occurred trapping his wife and child in the house below, said the Malappuram SI.

The CCTV recording had showed a disturbing video of Sarath, walking with an umbrella, on a road in Kottakkunnu, Malappuram. His mother who was walking towards him stops to talk. Someone watching the recording can be heard in the video commenting that the mother was telling the son to run. Sarath and Sarojini can be seen looking behind them as a mudslide crashes towards them out of nowhere, dragging down trees along the way. The son makes a dash for it, while Sarojini is pulled under the mud. Sarath, who is swept off by the harsh wind, hits a building and escapes.

The search operations were disrupted twice due to unfavourable weather conditions. Since there was no rain in Malappuram on Sunday, the rescue team was able to resume the search and recover the bodies of Geethu and Dhruvan. The bodies have been taken to Manjeri Government Medical College.

Malappuram has been one of the worst affected districts in the rain. At least 63 people, including children, are feared to be trapped underground after a major landslide occurred in Kavalappara. Nine bodies have been found so far and rescue operations are still on. The total number of people reported to have died in rain-related incidents in the state is 63."	pos

Eons of tectonic transit ended here in southern California sometime in the late Cenozoic with it lodged in the violent seam between the Pacific and North American plates. Those crushing forces lofted the ancient mass thousands of feet into the sky as the San Gabriel Mountains. And in February, about ten million pounds of it came crashing down on Angeles Crest Highway, where it finally became Christopher Harris' problem.

Harris is a senior geologist with the California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, and he's not much for complaining as he stands at the site in late April and stares at the ragged scar left by the landslide. But it's hard to think of thirty feet of rubble—an entire chunk of the mountain, dismembered—sitting atop a road he's tasked with protecting in any other fashion. Angeles Crest is the only path traversing the entire San Gabriel range, a historic trail paved with the can-do determination of an optimistic country, a critical link for the remote businesses and residents perched among the peaks, and a world-famous enthusiast playground 20 minutes from Los Angeles. It also doubles as State Route 2, which means Caltrans is locked in a Sisyphean battle to maintain 66 miles of a road surface suitable for 55-mph traffic through a mountain range that’s actively trying to destroy it.

Angeles Crest Highway a few days after the February 15 landslide., Caltrans

Yet the February 15 landslide, the biggest to hit Angeles Crest in decades, has shut down a four-mile chunk of the highway's heavily-traveled southern half for months, and it will stay closed until mid-June at the earliest. This is a rarity for Caltrans, which makes its bones fixing far-flung roads melted by wildfires or buried by avalanches; whatever you think about the speed of your local repairs, know that there are workers out there fixing minor disasters in some godforsaken corner of nowhere pretty much every hour of the day in a state like California. Estimated reopening dates have come and gone. It’s enough to make you wonder: What’s going on up there?

The answer is, of course, a lot. A rotating crew of fifty to sixty men has toiled nine hours a day, seven days a week for three months, slowing transforming the heaping pile of dirt and rock burying a hundred feet of SR-2 into a dusty repaving operation of the kind you’d see on Any Street, U.S.A.—screeds, rollers, asphalt trucks—except this one is still under daily assault from falling rocks as the mountain keeps crumbling. And so it's being met with a second effort to safeguard the road with a massive new retaining wall and steel net to cover the raw slope and catch (or attenuate in the technical parlance) any tumbling boulders.

The road wasn’t swept away like Route 1 in Big Sur when an entire peninsula collapsed into the sea in 2017. Angeles Crest Highway held fast—""It's a good, solid road bed, and they made it well,"" Harris says—and survived the debris fall mostly intact. But it’s still not safe for regular traffic, and it only takes a minute at the site to see there’s a whole lot more to do before it is. Caltrans currently estimates it's spent over half a million dollars on the cleanup so far.

""I know that it’s important to get this reopened. There’s no reason for a road to exist unless you can use it as a road. But that,"" Harris says, pointing at a softball-sized rock lying in the middle of a travel lane, the latest to fall that day. ""That could kill you.""

The Landslide Will Bring it Down

Looming 10,000 feet over Los Angeles like an unsteady drunk uncle, the San Gabriels are among the fastest-growing and fastest-eroding mountains in the world, vomiting loose rock with prodigious enthusiasm. Slides occur regularly across the range's 970 square miles of crumpled earth. It's not so much a question of when they fall but where they land. That natural instability is exacerbated by some truly wild weather swings—hot, dusty, distinctly Mediterranean in the summer, and winters where it's not uncommon for a foot of rain to fall in a day. It's through this gauntlet that California built Angeles Crest Highway in stages between 1929 and 1956.

The winter of 2018-19 was already zooming toward the record books at the end of January as storm after storm flew off the Pacific and cluster-bombed the mountains with flooding rains and drifting snow. It started with a single crack. Sometime in early February, a small rift opened in the earth, no more than five feet long and an inch wide at first, a few hundred feet above a particularly scenic bend in the highway just north of Mount Wilson. Tension cracks are classic harbingers of a landslide, a sign that the ground is literally coming apart. But there was no one to see the linear canary sprawled amidst the chaparral and yucca as it grew over the coming days, rain working its way down into the rock and unlocking the slope from within.

At around noon on February 15, a gray, drizzly Friday, the mountain could hold it together no more. In an instant, millions of pounds of dirt and rock tumbled down on Angeles Crest Highway, burying a dinky retaining wall built in the aftermath of a much smaller slide in 2006 and both lanes of the roadway under 30 feet of rubble. The force of the landslide also sent debris cartwheeling over the pavement's far edge and down the slope another 300 feet. Harris, ever the underseller, says it ""probably made a pretty good noise.""

Caltrans

So constant is the fight against rockfalls along Angeles Crest that every single day, Caltrans runs battered snowplows up and down its entire length to shove small boulders out of the road. One of those units first came upon the landslide that Friday and radioed it in. Miraculously there was no one underneath when it let go, though as Harris pointed out, there's no way of knowing for sure until you start digging. The story would have been much different had it come down just 24 hours later in the middle of the weekend when the road is packed with car clubs, nature fiends, and sightseers alike.

""Does He Have a Harness for Those Balls, Too?""

That fateful radio call kicked a sprawling, dormant machine into motion. Caltrans quickly dispatched two front-end loaders to the site in a hopeful bid to start clearing the road; once the scale became apparent, the agency sent out emergency contracts to qualified debris disposal firms. As the lead geologist in Caltrans District 7, which covers the San Gabriel Mountains, Harris went to see the disaster himself that very first day. And he immediately knew it was going to be a long process to clean it up.

Stabilizing a landslide zone isn't just a matter of removing the material that's already fallen. To start, you've got a great mass of loose material stretching from the road to back up the slope. Harris likens it to digging a hole in the beach—scoop out the bottom and the hole just backfills from up top, creating the potential for another slide. The trick is to get at it from above and remove anything that's loose. Sometimes, Harris says, you get lucky with a utility road snaking nearby that affords easy access. Other times, when faced with a 70-degree incline, you send in the rock scalers.

Rock scalers are the advance troops in this particular battle between man and geology. They are highly-specialized climbers who scamper up the inimical terrain and use hand tools and occasionally explosives to remove any and all loose rock, some of which can be dislodged with a single finger. It's incredibly dangerous work, strung up by ropes anchored to a surface that's already experienced a catastrophic failure. But there's no other way of ensuring the mountain is out of ammunition, and no real progress can be made on the main body of the slide until this risk is neutralized.

After a few weeks—all the while, the rains kept coming, triggering smaller slides and further complications—it was time to bring the spider out to play. A spider excavator is an all-terrain digger sitting on a quadrangle of articulating arms and anchors that allow it to sit mostly level on slanted ground. It quite literally climbs its way up from the bottom, a many-ton mechanical arachnid heaving itself skyward for the better part of an hour to reach the top of the pile. Once there, its brave operator removes bucketfuls of dirt and rock to slowly but surely erase the landslide from above.

He works the controls with his seatbelt off and the door open in case he needs to jump free as the rig falls away beneath him; even when it's ""anchored,"" it's forever slipping towards the precipice. Seeing the spider perched 200 feet above his head, one visiting California Highway Patrol officer asked, ""Does he have a harness for those balls, too?""

Caltrans

The spider excavator was on site for most of March, working its way down to fully expose the dramatic scar left by the slide. Crews rigged up a pulley system to fling diesel up the mountain and cut down on time-consuming fuel stops. Back down on the road, workers could begin tackling that 30-foot pile of regolith. Enough material to overfill the Goodyear Blimp was gradually carted down the road to a U.S. Forest Service-approved dumping site where it's piled in a massive mound that will be seeded with native grasses and returned to the landscape.

The battered pavement of Angeles Crest Highway finally emerged at the end of the month, as did the stumpy old retaining wall—bent and splintered but still intact. Harris will admit to smiling at the sight. The slide's mass is officially gone. The danger, however, is not.

The Plan to Fix Angeles Crest Highway

Caltrans couldn't pick a better front man for the San Gabriels than Christopher Harris, whose energy is a perfect match for the mountains—latent, reserved, and always ready to strike down a silly question. He's been with Caltrans for 28 years, seen a lot over those three decades. He's not prepared to let something like the biggest landslide in recent memory on Angeles Crest Highway push him into a philosophical discussion on the fight against nature itself. He just wants to get it done.

Jonathan Harper

I met Harris walking down the road toward the landslide on a gorgeous Monday morning after being shepherded through two police roadblocks that exist because one simply doesn't do the job. The mountainside came down in the middle of a sweeping right-hand bend above a tight canyon; approaching from the south provides a perfect view of the entire slide site both above and below the road. The scale is such that it looks curiously small until you pick out the tiny dump trucks shuttling back and forth across its face. Where once existed rocks, plants, and animal burrows there is nothing, a void, a giant halfpipe a hundred feet wide gouged deep into the earth and scored by unthinkable violence.

Get closer, and the remaining slope is so steep that you can barely see fifty feet up when standing directly under it. I could only think one thing: That spider operator is f*cking insane. But Harris has an even more daring operation to impress a soft-handed lowlander. The week before my visit, a natural spring opened up in the middle of the newly-exposed rock face, spewing 14 gallons a minute and digging a destabilizing cave. It was too dangerous even for the rock scalers—so the contractor used a construction crane to lift workers up to the site and seal it.

Still, with its intact road and paving equipment, the worksite manages the passing resemblance to any municipal construction project until I notice the watchman. He's standing on a berm across the road from the slide, staring intently up at the windswept slope, and his entire job is to watch and yell ""ROCK!"" the moment he sees something move. He does not break focus. There's no way to completely stop the rocks from falling; Harris says it's the wind that makes him the most nervous. ""A gust will get swept up in this channel here,"" he says, pointing to the halfpipe, ""and literally lift rocks off the face of it."" Usually they're small. Sometimes they're not.

The watchman., Jonathan Harper

Now, the plan is thus: Caltrans will build a new 150-foot retaining wall where the road's double yellow line currently sits, about 15 feet in front of where the old one was positioned. That extra length and space will allow it to catch far more debris than before, ideally providing enough of a buffer to prevent a disastrous repeat should a new slide come down in the future.

Angeles Crest Highway itself will slide out from the mountain as well, with the outside lane running along the former soft shoulder, now entombed in fresh, gleaming asphalt. Finally, a massive steel cable net will be draped over the giant scar to stop falling rocks from picking up speed and bouncing over the new wall.

Easy, right? Building the wall involves driving immense steel pilings 15 feet into the ground and filling the gaps with massive hunks of timber. Re-routing the road will create a decreasing radius turn from the south, which means traffic engineers have to sign off on the final design and figure out the correct speed limit to apply. The football-field-sized net has to be manufactured to order and shipped to the site, where it will be hoisted by helicopters and secured with another daring aerial operation. The calculations for these moving parts didn't resolve until the slide was stabilized in early April. And of course, all this work is taking place with the implicit understanding that a rock could come along at any time and knock your head off. Nothing is easy in the mountains.

Harris mentioned bushwhacking to a vantage point halfway up the scar as part of his regular observations; to my surprise, he quickly agreed when I asked to go up as well. Government agencies are generally not very keen on purposefully putting you in harms way. Harris seemed to relish the chance, especially given the sentinel nature of his job. After scampering up a nearby gully that a deer might second guess, dodging spiky yucca plants (""You really don't want to fall on those, trust me.""), and stepping over rattlesnake holes, we reached a tiny flat about 10 feet from the edge of the slide.

The perspective is the complete inverse from before—now it's the worksite below that looks recast in miniature, while the sheer size of the mountain's missing chunk is impossible to ignore. I tried to imagine a low-flying helicopter delicately draping a metal net across the gap, working in tandem with crews of climbers to lock it in place. Forget the Bolshoi—this is the ballet.

""ROCK!""

We'd only been back down on the road for a few minutes, catching our breath as a handful of workers smooth out some fresh asphalt directly in front of the busted retaining wall, when a scream pierced the air. ""ROCK!"" The crew scrambled away, backpedalling furiously with their eyes locked uphill. Seconds later, a softball-sized chunk of gneiss came skipping down into view and smacked harmlessly against the backside of the wall with a dull thud. The guys resumed their tasks with a few nervous chuckles.

Jonathan Harper

I glanced over at Harris, who was wearing a look of...not satisfaction, but vindication. He pointed out that second rock lying in the road, the one that could kill you, which had bounced over the old wall. He's right that it could have taken out a driver or motorcyclist unlucky enough to be passing by at the wrong moment.

That is ultimately his number one concern: Not the lost tourism dollars, not the inconvenienced enthusiasts, not the repair's extended timeline, but the fragile illusion of safety on which modern life functions. At the earliest, the road might open at the beginning of June—or it might not. Like the landslide itself, the recovery timeline is being dictated by forces that human beings can only hope to influence, let alone control. And besides, for anyone really itching to run that particular four-mile stretch of Angeles Crest, Harris has a simple question: ""Would you want to be driving your family in your nice convertible with the top down through here right now?"" The answer is no.

OSO, Wash. — The families of victims in the Oso Mudslide hosted a remembrance ceremony on Friday – five years to the day since a mudslide killed 43 people.

The landslide wiped out a neighborhood and destroyed dozens of homes when it roared down a hillside above the north fork of the Stillaguamish River.

The 10 a.m. remembrance ceremony was held at the site of the future home of the slide memorial.

Example video title will go here for this video

BOULDER, Colo. — A planned blast inadvertently brought down the equivalent of 8,000 washing machine-sized rocks onto CO 119 in Boulder Canyon on Wednesday afternoon, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) said in a news release.

The highway was closed for hours but reopened with one lane of alternating traffic at about 4 a.m. Thursday after geotech experts determined the slope was stable and additional blasting was not needed on part of the rockface, CDOT said.

To clear the road for one lane of traffic, crews spent the overnight hours blasting several large boulders into smaller pieces that could be hauled away.

The road will close again at 10 a.m. to allow crews to continue cleanup efforts, according to CDOT. It will reopen with at least one lane again at 2 p.m.

“We thank everyone for their continued patience as we work through a technically complex effort,” Colorado Department of Transportation Executive Director Shoshana Lew said. “This work is important for keeping people safe when driving in mountain areas, but it’s difficult work and we know that it causes inconvenience for the traveling public during construction.”

No one was injured during the incident, which was part of a flood construction project that involved blasting the mountain to move more of the road onto bedrock so it will be more stable in the event of rising waters, CDOT said.

A regular blast typically brings down around 400 cubic yards of rock each time. This blast brought 8,000 cubic yards of rock down the side of the mountain and onto the road. To put that into perspective, CDOT said each cubic yard is the size of a normal washing machine.

Rocks that size are too large to be moved as they are, according to CDOT, which means the agency needed to conduct additional blasts to clear them.

Travelers are asked to avoid the Boulder Canyon route, if possible. CDOT recommends these detours:

A northern alternate route can be taken via CO 7, US 36 and CO 72.

A southern alternate route is available via CO 93 and CO 72.

Drivers heading to the Denver area can continue south on CO 72 and CO 119 the east on US 6 into Golden."	pos

The slide generated a miles of backup for hours on Interstate 40 on Friday night.

ASHEVILLE – A slide of rocks, dirt and trees will keep a 20-mile section of Interstate 40 in Western North Carolina closed for up to a week as crews remove debris and set up an alternate route.

The slide of about 20,000 cubic yards of material occurred around 7:30 p.m. Friday at mile marker 7.5, near the Harmon Den exit.

""We had a small slide with rocks falling from a pretty high elevation, and when they were hitting the road, they were bouncing into the eastbound lanes,"" said Ted Adams, construction engineer for NC Department of Transportation's District 14, on Saturday afternoon.

More:What we know about the I-40 rockslide closure: Details, timeline and detours

NCDOT closed I-40 westbound at exit 20 (U.S. 276) and eastbound lanes at the Tennessee state line. Both lanes were closed for the safety of both drivers and cleanup teams.

While crews on Saturday cut down trees on the slope, which sits right at the edge of the roadway on a curve, dirt, rocks and more would periodically slide down into the westbound lanes.

NCDOT crews will set up the eastbound lanes to allow for one lane in each direction for about 1,500-2,000 feet around the slide site. ""Absolutely in a week we'll have traffic running out here,"" Adams said.

""Our goal is to get this cleaned up as soon as possible,"" he added. They will work 24 hours a day to get traffic flowing again.

But moving all the dirt, rocks and debris from the slope will take longer — about four to six weeks. ""We hope we can do it quicker, but that's our preliminary estimate,"" he said.

Car damage and backed up traffic

When the slide started on Friday, nine cars were damaged, many getting flat tires from running over rocks in the road, Adams said. One car was hit on the side by a falling rock when as the vehicle stopped so it didn't hit debris in the road. No people were hurt.

The slide generated miles of backup for hours on Interstate 40, and NC State Highway Patrol helped clear the backup by turning cars around. This stretch of road carries an average of 26,000 cars daily.

Tractor-trailers were guided through the slide zone by crews watching the slope rather than backing them up to the rest area 2 miles away, as was the initial plan, Adams said.

In cleaning up the slide, the slope itself will be scaled back, taking the weight off, Adams said, to prevent future slides.

A small slide, by comparison

The last major slide in the area was in 2009.

""Most of our slides have been over 100,000 cubic yards, which is about a thousand dump truck loads of material. This one's closer to 20,000 cubic yards,"" Adams said.

Geotechnical engineers have ""scoured this entire gorge"" looking for other potential trouble areas. ""We know where all the hot spots are. The problem is we just don't know when and where.""

A rock excavation about three years was done just west of the site of the current to prevent a major slide from occurring, he said.

Harrison Construction has received an emergency contract to perform the work. Its crews were expected on site Saturday afternoon to begin work on the project.

Adams estimated the cost of the project to be around $750,000, which will be paid out of federal funds.

What is the DOT's I-40 detour?

DOT's detour is a long one but familiar one: It takes westbound traffic back to Asheville and sends drivers onto I-240 east to I-26 west into Tennessee. From I-26, drivers take I-81 south back to I-40. Eastbound traffic should follow in reverse: I-40 to I-81 to I-26 to I-40.

The detour, from exit 20 near Waynesville, is about 160 miles long.

Both Adams and NCDOT spokesman David Uchiyama urged drivers to stick to the posted detour rather than following GPS directions.

A history of slides

In February 2012, the interstate was shut for several days because of a slide just west of mile marker 7. At the same time, a slide had blocked the roadway on the Tennessee side at the state line.

But a much bigger slide occurred in 2009, closing the major trucking route for six months.

At that time, engineers installed 543 bolts into the rock face, designed to keep the rock wall from sheering off in the future. The 150-foot-tall rockslide closed the interstate near the Tennessee line on Oct. 25, 2009. Nearly 20,000 vehicles a day had used that stretch of interstate, at the time.

20	91	https://theconversation.com/thawing-permafrost-is-triggering-thousands-of-landslides-across-the-arctic-114702	Thawing permafrost is triggering thousands of landslides across the Arctic	2019-04-03 12:55:15+00:00	"Early spring temperatures in the town of Deadhorse, on the north coast of Alaska, average -17°C. But with global warming affecting the Arctic more than anywhere, things are changing fast. At the end of March 2019, temperatures in Deadhorse hit 3°C, a whole 20°C warmer than the long-term seasonal average.

Such huge variations are not normal or natural, and it is important we understand their long term environmental impacts. Now, scientists working on an island off the north coast of Canada, relatively near to Deadhorse, have discovered evidence that warming in the Arctic is triggering thousands of landslides that could reshape the landscape for good.

The landslides are found in those high latitude areas where the ground consists of frozen soil and rock, known as “permafrost”. Closer to the poles, and at higher elevations, the surface can be frozen all year. Where temperatures are slightly less cold in the summer, perhaps because of a lower altitude or a greater distance from the pole, the surface of the permafrost melts most years. This melted layer is often saturated with water and thus is very weak, creating boggy conditions when the thaw develops. And where the permafrost is on a slope, melting often rapidly leads to instability, resulting in landslides.

As temperatures rise, those “summer months” above freezing can stretch into spring and autumn, the hottest days become hotter, and large areas of permafrost are melting. One potential impact is an increase in landslides, and recent studies have suggested that there is some evidence that this might be occurring on some high altitude slopes.

But the latest research from Canada, published in the journal Nature Communications, has demonstrated a dramatic increase in landslides in recent years – even at sea level. The researchers focused on Banks Island, an expanse of treeless tundra about the size of Sri Lanka or Ireland, with 68,000 muskoxen and just 112 humans.

NSIDC / Philippe Rekacewicz, UNEP/GRID-Arendal

They looked at a particular type of landslide known as “retrogressive thaw slumps” which can occur on comparatively gentle slopes when permafrost thaws. These landslides generally move slowly downhill, but what makes them particularly problematic is that once they start they tend to grow, and it is very difficult to arrest their development.

The team looked for signs of these landslides in archive imagery of Banks Island between 1984 and 2015. The results were dramatic: in 1984 only 63 active retrogressive thaw slumps could be identified, but by 2013 this number had increased to 4,077 – a 60-fold increase. Mapping the number of new landslides occurring each year over the study period, scientists realised that many more landslides developed in years with particularly warm summers. In the four warmest summers – 1999, 2011, 2012 and 2013 – almost 3,900 landslides developed.

This could be happening right across the Arctic

The study has significant implications. First, it shows a dramatic increase in the rate of permafrost degradation through landsliding. Most of the new landslides are now causing substantial erosion as the released sediment moves into watercourses and will cause changes in lakes and rivers even away from the landslides.

Second, it is clear that these changes are associated with years with high summer temperatures. While this study only looked at a single – albeit very large – island in Canada, there is nothing exceptional about this region climatically or geologically, which suggests that something similar will be happening in many other permafrost areas.

And finally, rising temperatures in the Arctic mean permafrost is likely to degrade at a dramatically increased rate. Using the IPCC climate projections, in this area alone the researchers expect 10,000 or more new landslides per decade by 2075. If this is extended across other permafrost areas in Canada, Siberia and beyond, high latitude climate change will have a major impact on the landscape. This is likely to alter the ecosystems in these areas, but as yet it is impossible to estimate the ways in which they will change.

Through time we are getting a better sense of how landscapes are responding to changes in climate. It is clear that permafrost is extremely sensitive to change – and the effects are likely to be profound.

AUSTIN, Texas — After ""additional movement"" was reported in the area of the Shoal Creek landslide May 8, the Watershed Protection department in Austin is asking the public to stay away from the area.

In a press release sent May 10, the department said the landslide is located on the west side of Shoal Creek between 24th Street and Shoal Creek Boulevard. There is debris from the landslide that is partially blocking Shoal Creek, which ""poses an increased flood risk for Lamar Blvd. and a few buildings in this area,"" the department said.

There is a plan to put sandbags down, keeping water away from slopes, and a design to reroute water. The plan also includes putting up a series of walls, including two large ones with anchors that tie into the slope and sustain walls.

“One of the factors that contributes to movement along the slope is additional water falling onto that slope,"" said Diana Wang, with the city's watershed protection department.

The plan is expected to go in front of the city council on June 20 and could cost between $8 million to $16 million.

The public should keep using the sidewalk on Lamar Boulevard as a detour from the Shoal Creek Trail and should stay away from the area of the landslide.

""The thing that’s complicated with this situation is in order to really stabilize the slope, it has to be a solution that addresses the entire slope,"" said Wang. ""In order for it to be safe and unfortunately that crosses property lines.”

This additional movement comes after a landslide last May after heavy storms that took out a few neighbor's backyards above and west of the creek.

The city has already spent more than a million dollars to fix the trail, including the landslide area."	pos

The protest near the Luilu plant follows the eviction last week of thousands of illegal miners from Glencore’s Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) concession in southern Democratic Republic of Congo after 43 people died in a landslide.

The witness, a member of a local civil society organization, said at least 50 protesters had gathered outside the plant to demand access to the nearby Mayi ya Mbata open cast mine, owned by the state company Gecamines.

In response, seven vehicles carrying soldiers arrived on the scene and attempted to disperse the crowd, he said.

Glencore said in a statement that about 80 people had protested on the national road in the town of Luilu. It said the army had dispersed the crowd and that no injuries had been reported.

Army and government officials did not respond to requests for comment.

The decision last week by the government to use the army to evict miners illegally digging on the KCC concession, which is majority-owned by a Glencore subsidiary, sparked angry protests outside the local governor’s office and looting of shops last Thursday.

The government of Lualaba province, where KCC is located, has promised to provide other concessions where the evicted miners can dig, but they are skeptical that these will be sufficient to absorb them all.

Small-scale mining for copper and cobalt is one of the few viable economic activities available to much of the population. The miners use rudimentary tools to burrow dozens of meters below ground, leading to frequent accidents.

Activists say the deployment of the army to tackle the issue of illegal artisanal mining could lead to violence and human rights abuses, and have urged authorities to do more to address chronic poverty and unemployment.

Glencore said that, prior to last week’s eviction, about 2,000 illegal miners were entering KCC every day. The Lualaba government estimates that 170,000 informal miners operate across the province."	neg

The Angeles Crest Highway has finally reopened after months of repairs.

After the Woolsey Fire and other smaller wildfires ripped through thousands of acres through Ventura and Los Angeles counties last year, it was followed by unusually heavy rainfall that led to debris flows and rock slides throughout the area, including along Angeles Crest Highway.

A major rock slide on Feb. 15, 2019, forced the closure of a 19-mile stretch of Angeles Crest Highway, which also doubles as State Route 2 and acts as the only path that cuts through the San Gabriel Mountains.

After more than eight months of delays as crews worked to clear the rocks from the roadway, pave the highway shoulder and install metal fencing, the Angeles Crest Highway reopened to motorists and cyclists Tuesday, Caltrans said.

UPDATE: Angeles Crest Highway (SR-2) is CLOSED at Mt. Wilson / Red Box Rd to Upper Big Tujunga Cyn Rd to repair a slide that occurred in winter storm on Feb. 15. Next step: Crane will install steel mesh curtains (low right on ground) to stabilize hillside. May open in July/Aug. pic.twitter.com/GlX7YDVDo9 — Caltrans District 7 (@CaltransDist7) May 31, 2019

When the rocks came crashing down the roadway during a February storm, officials closed it down between Rincon Red Box Road and Upper Big Tujunga Canyon Road, and initially estimated it would reopen in April. But storms that followed in March caused more slope failure near the top of the slide as crews were working.

While the 19-mile stretch was reopened Tuesday, Caltrans warned motorists that intermittent closures are expected as crews complete installing the retaining wall.

Campsites in the area remained open throughout the closure and were expected to stay open through November, though camp fires are not allowed due to high winds and elevated wildfire danger, officials said.

THE GATES ARE OPEN!

A massive cliff on what has been described as the UK’s longest and best-loved national trail came crashing down onto the beach in the early hours of this morning.

Just days after a 90 metre crack formed along the South West Coast Path a huge chunk of cliff collapsed onto the beach near near in the early hours Sunday November 15, 2020.

The collapse has pushed the cliff edge between Eype and West Bay in Dorset back about 15 metres from where it was previously.

Three weeks ago the local council cornered off a 200 metre section after cracks started to appear on the cliff edge on the 630 mile trail.

Some say the area that disappeared into the sea is even bigger than that roped off for the safety of walkers.

Visitors to the scenic cliff are currently allowed to walk through a nearby Highlands End Holiday Park after the landowner granted permission but the long term future of the path has yet to be decided.

The collapse means the cliff edge is now around 50 metres from the nearest pitches at the holiday park.

Tara Hansford, Dorset Council countryside access development officer, said: ""Movement in this section has rapidly increased, affecting an extensive area with more cracks appearing and sections collapsing, resulting in extremely dangerous, uneven and unstable ground.

""All the signs indicate this whole area of cliff is vulnerable and sections are regularly falling.""

She praised the owner of the holiday park for allowing access for walkers.

She said: ""Fortunately, the adjacent landowner – Highlands End Holiday Park – has kindly granted permissive access so the public can still follow the coast path and enjoy the cliff top views this section provides.

""They recognise this stretch is particularly important for local people from Eype and West Bay who regularly walk this path connecting the two communities.

""We just ask that walkers are mindful that they are walking within the boundary of the holiday park and keep to the permissive path, with dogs on leads at all times."""	pos

Scuba divers managed to retrieve 12 coffins from the sea by Wednesday after the landslide in the town of Camogli, about 8 miles north of Portofino, two days earlier. Most of the coffins from the cemetery remained strewn around and under the rubble caused by the landslide.

Relatives of people who had been buried in the cemetery gathered in the main square of the seaside town to get news and protest what they said was negligence by local authorities.

“It was the only place where I could go see my parents and talk to them,” Clara Terrile, 66, who owns a shoe shop in Camogli, said in a phone interview Wednesday. “Now I am left with nothing.”

The landslide was probably caused by erosion of the cliff under the cemetery, worsened by storms that have hit the fragile Ligurian coast in recent years, according to Italy’s National Council of Geologists.

“This event hit the community hard emotionally,” said Francesco Olivari, mayor of Camogli. “The whole Liguria is characterized by these phenomena; it was hard to foresee it,” he said.

The landslide, which occurred down the coast from Genoa, where a bridge collapsed in 2018, killing 43 people, prompted outrage in Italy about a lack of infrastructure maintenance and the prevention of natural disasters. Prosecutors in Genoa have opened an investigation into the collapse of the cemetery.

“This is Italy, even dead people cannot rest in peace,” one person lamented on Twitter.

The landslide shows “the lack of maintenance that we geologists have denounced for years,” Domenico Angelone, secretary of the National Council of Geologists, said in a statement. Despite their “high social, moral and cultural value,” cemeteries are often built in unstable places and in recent years suffered a “lack of attention,” he added.

The town had started work to solidify the cliff by the cemetery and in recent days the area had been enclosed after officials had noticed cracks and heard some “creaking,” Olivari, the mayor, said. Some locals protested that they had been reporting cracks and problems with the cemetery’s structure for years.

Lilla Mariotti, a resident of Camogli, posted on Facebook a picture of cracks in the cemetery walls she said she sent the mayor in 2012. “I never got any answers,” she wrote.

Terrile said that she wrote to the town hall in 2007 reporting cracks at the front of her father’s grave but also never received an answer. In 2019, she reported more cracks, and the town hall fixed them, she said. A couple of weeks ago, in a visit to the graveyard, she noticed that the same cracks had reappeared.

“I hope my parents are among the bodies they have found,” she said, “I don’t even have a place where I can bring a flower anymore.”

Olivari, the mayor, said the town had set up psychological support for the families affected.

Regional authorities asked for help from national rescue services since the operation to search for the coffins and bodies depended on the safety on the cliff, which was at risk of further collapse.

For now, scuba divers can only rescue coffins floating in the sea as most of the others are buried under the rubble of the landslide, said Giacomo Giampedrone, the top regional civil protection official.

Slideshow ( 4 images )

The rains from June to September are a lifeline for rural India, delivering some 70% of the country’s rainfall, but they also cause death and destruction each year.

The southern states of Kerala and Karnataka, and Maharashtra and Gujarat in the west, were among the hardest hit by floods that washed away thousands of hectares of summer-sown crops and damaged roads and rail lines.

At least 95 people were killed and more than 50 are missing in Kerala, where heavy rainfall triggered dozens of landslides last week and trapped more than 100 people.

About 190,000 people are still living in relief camps in the state, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, but he added some people are returning home as flood waters recede.

In neighboring Karnataka, home to the technology hub Bengaluru, 54 people died and 15 are missing after rivers burst their banks when authorities released water from dams.

Nearly 700,000 people have been evacuated in the state.

Heavy rainfall is expected in parts of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat, as well as the central state of Madhya Pradesh, in the next two days, weather officials said.

In Maharashtra, which includes the financial capital Mumbai, 48 people died but flood waters are receding, said a state official.

“We are now trying to restore electricity and drinking water supplies,” he said.

In Madhya Pradesh, the biggest producer of soybeans, heavy rains killed 32 people and damaged crops, authorities said.

In Gujarat, 31 people died in rain-related incidents, while landslides killed nearly a dozen people in the northern hilly state of Uttarakhand."	neg

Example video title will go here for this video

BOULDER, Colo. — A planned blast inadvertently brought down the equivalent of 8,000 washing machine-sized rocks onto CO 119 in Boulder Canyon on Wednesday afternoon, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) said in a news release.

The highway was closed for hours but reopened with one lane of alternating traffic at about 4 a.m. Thursday after geotech experts determined the slope was stable and additional blasting was not needed on part of the rockface, CDOT said.

To clear the road for one lane of traffic, crews spent the overnight hours blasting several large boulders into smaller pieces that could be hauled away.

The road will close again at 10 a.m. to allow crews to continue cleanup efforts, according to CDOT. It will reopen with at least one lane again at 2 p.m.

“We thank everyone for their continued patience as we work through a technically complex effort,” Colorado Department of Transportation Executive Director Shoshana Lew said. “This work is important for keeping people safe when driving in mountain areas, but it’s difficult work and we know that it causes inconvenience for the traveling public during construction.”

No one was injured during the incident, which was part of a flood construction project that involved blasting the mountain to move more of the road onto bedrock so it will be more stable in the event of rising waters, CDOT said.

A regular blast typically brings down around 400 cubic yards of rock each time. This blast brought 8,000 cubic yards of rock down the side of the mountain and onto the road. To put that into perspective, CDOT said each cubic yard is the size of a normal washing machine.

Rocks that size are too large to be moved as they are, according to CDOT, which means the agency needed to conduct additional blasts to clear them.

Travelers are asked to avoid the Boulder Canyon route, if possible. CDOT recommends these detours:

A northern alternate route can be taken via CO 7, US 36 and CO 72.

A southern alternate route is available via CO 93 and CO 72.

Drivers heading to the Denver area can continue south on CO 72 and CO 119 the east on US 6 into Golden."	pos

Park spokeswoman Lauren Alley describes the rockfall near the East Tunnel as ""significant.""

""So, the rocks were between fist-sized and about twelve inches in diameter. If you envision that, that’s a pretty big-sized rock. There was enough debris, the Park estimates, to fill the back of a pickup truck.""

The rocks hit the top of the family’s car, shattering its rear windshield, critically injuring the girl. Her parents received significant bruising and two other children in the car suffered minor injuries.

An air ambulance responded to the scene but was unable to airlift the girl because of her unstable condition. The flight paramedics traveled with her in a ground ambulance to Kalispell, but she died on the way.

The family is from Utah. The girl’s name and hometown will be released once family notifications are complete.

This isn’t the first fatal rockslide in the park.

""The last fatal rockfall on the Going-to-the-Sun road was in 1996,"" says park spokeswoman Lauren Alley. ""A rock came off the mountain in the Rimrocks area which is west of Logan Pass. The area is on the Continental Divide and rocks do come down fairly regularly from the mountains above.""

The mountains above Going-to-the-Sun Road are very steep and Alley says precisely identifying where the slide originated would be extremely difficult.

Ally says the park, while safe for the vast majority of visitors, can sometimes be an unpredictable place where hazardous things can happen in an instant.

Going-to-the-Sun Road was closed at the East Tunnel for about three hours Monday night while crews cleared the scene."	pos

The combination of this, plus high winds, is shutting down travel in the Sierra. Another atmospheric river event is pummeling California with feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, shattering February snow records at some ski resorts while also triggering flooding, rockslides and mudslides in lower elevations.

Happening Now

Heavy snow continues to pound the Sierra, generally above 5,000 feet, while rain persists in the lower elevations of Northern California.

Gusty winds are also expected into this evening in some locations.

(INTERACTIVE: Current Radar/Satellite Loop)

Tuesday night into early Wednesday, numerous roadways were flooded in Northern California, including the Bay area. Several mudslides and rockslides were also reported, as were downed trees and power lines.

Venado, California, measured 20.48 inches of rainfall through early Wednesday.

(LATEST: Flooding, Mudslides, Travel Impacts)

As of Wednesday morning, 55 inches of snow fell in Boreal, with 54 inches at Sugar Bowl Ski.

The combination of heavy snow and high winds prompted Interstate 80 to shut down overnight Monday night into Tuesday.

Several other routes into the Sierra were shut down Tuesday as well, according to Caltrans.

Many Sierra ski locations reported at least a foot of snow in 24 hours ending Tuesday morning. Caltrans reported 40 inches of snow had fallen in 24 hours at Donner Pass.

Despite all the snow, it was too windy to ski at some Sierra resorts. Lifts were on hold at Mammoth Mountain, and some lifts were closed Monday at Heavenly.

Advertisement Strong winds have also been blasting parts of Northern California and Nevada. Winds gusted between 50 and 60 mph in Reno, Nevada, on Tuesday.

Rain soaked the lower elevations of Northern California on Tuesday, mainly north of Interstate 80, and that has triggered flooding and some landslides.

A number of mudslides shut down State Highway 49 in multiple locations. Just over 5 inches of rain was reported in Quincy, California, about 35 miles east-northeast of the fire-scarred town of Paradise.

Flooding was also reported in parts of Marin County, California, and the Napa Valley. All access roads into Point Reyes National Seashore, north of San Francisco, were flooded Tuesday morning.

Active Weather Pattern in the West

This round of rain and snow is just the latest in a series of storms that have impacted the West in February.

Mammoth Mountain has already clobbered its previous record-snowiest February, picking up 198 inches of snow so far this month.

Squaw Valley is likely to set its snowiest month on record, already measuring over 21 feet of snow this month before this storm kicked into gear.

Tuesday morning, a snow depth of 226.9 inches was estimated by the National Resources Conservation Service SNOTEL network at a sensor about 20 miles southwest of Truckee, California. Another sensor at Nevada's Mt. Rose Ski Area estimated a whopping 320 inches of snow cover at an elevation of 8,850 feet.

Most importantly, the Sierra is an important source of water for California when winter's snowpack melts in the dry season from late spring through early fall.

(MORE: West's Active Winter So Far Has Had a Huge Impact on Drought)

According to the California Department of Water Resources, the statewide water content of the Sierra snowpack was estimated to be 41 percent above average for Feb. 26.

Rescue teams spent the day scouring the rubble of destroyed houses in the town of Bafoussam in the western highlands. Among the bodies recovered were those of 26 children, Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV) reported.

The search will resume on Wednesday for additional bodies believed to remain under the rubble, CRTV reported.

""Around 10pm, I heard a noise,"" said Mr Albert Kenge, who survived the landslide. ""I saw a big cloud of dust and when it dissipated, I saw that the mountain had collapsed.""

Heavy rains have continued beyond the end of Central Africa's rainy season, causing severe flooding which has displaced nearly 30,000 people in Cameroon's neighbour, the Central African Republic.

Mountain hares in Scotland are failing to adapt to climate change, making them more vulnerable to predators:

“A team of researchers from the U.S. and the U.K. has found that mountain hares in Scotland have not been changing their molt times in response to climate change.”

Beluga whistles and clicks could be silenced by an increasingly noisy Arctic Ocean:

“Climate change is causing sea ice to melt earlier in the spring and to freeze later in the autumn, which leads to a longer open-water season. This is allowing greater access for human activities, including noisy activities such as shipping.”

Frozen Arctic soils are set to release vast amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere as they continue to thaw in coming decades… the scale and speed of this important climate process remain uncertain.

“To help address this knowledge gap, ESA-funded researchers have developed and released a new permafrost dataset – the longest, satellite-derived permafrost record currently available.”

The moon could be affecting how much methane is released from the Arctic Ocean seafloor, a new study finds.

“The tides, which are controlled by the moon, affect how much methane is released from seafloor sediments: Low tides mean less pressure and more methane released, while high tides create more pressure, and therefore less methane emission…

“It means that slight pressure changes can release significant amounts of methane. This is a game-changer and the highest impact of the study,” study coauthor, Jochen Knies, a marine geologist at the Centre for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Environment and Climate, said.”

The icy colossus [iceberg] that is A68a has knocked off a corner, seemingly as a result of striking the seafloor.

“The 3,800-sq-km iceberg, which has been bearing down on the island of South Georgia, looked in recent days to be turning with the prevailing current. But as it spun around, it appears part of the frozen block may have scraped the bed, inflicting damage on itself.”

Smoke from wildfires could be a surprising new route for the spread of infections, according to research. Scientist say that microbes and fungi can survive in large numbers in smoky plumes.

“The authors believe it’s likely that organisms from the soil, known to cause infection, could be transferred in this way. They argue that greater monitoring of wildfire smoke by health authorities is urgently needed.”

The Pali is now open in both directions from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays through Fridays. The highway will remain closed on Saturdays through early November to allow further repairs to be completed.

Access to the Pali, a major route connecting Windward Oahu to town, has been limited to Honolulu- bound motorists in the mornings and, subsequently, Kailua-bound drivers in the afternoons, since the February rockfall required an estimated $21 million in emergency repairs.

The work includes slope stabilization as well as the new concrete structure, or “rock shed,” that extends the second Honolulu-bound tunnel’s entrance by about 80 feet to shield motorists from future rockfalls.

Access hours to the highway have gradually increased as repairs were completed, but there has been a three-month delay in fully opening the highway, originally anticipated to happen in August. Additional slope work — as well as work on top of the rock shed — will require nighttime closures until November."	pos

Lt. Gov. Josh Green, acting on the governor’s behalf, issued an emergency declaration Friday for the thoroughfare.

The declaration is aimed at providing funds to address the damage and speed up repairs.

State Transportation Department officials have said it could take months to finish work to stabilize hillsides above the Honolulu-bound lanes of the highway.

In the meantime, the highway remains partially or fully closed.

The highway will remain fully closed during the weekend hours.

Green is acting governor as Gov. David Ige is in Washington, D.C. for the National Governors Association meeting.

Landslides in Greater Cincinnati are bad. And they'll probably get worse.	2019-03-05 00:00:00	"When Tom Gerrein left for Mass on Easter Sunday in 2010, he had a flat backyard.

When he returned home, he did not.

Tom and his wife, Kathy, walked behind their house in Bellevue and there it was. A landslide had cut their backyard in two, leaving a big crack through the middle and pulling the bottom half of the yard downhill.

Tom was shocked. He had heard of his neighbors having trouble with landslides but didn’t think his own property was in any danger. It turned out his yard was one of 39 caught up in a landslide, spread among several Bellevue streets.

One of Tom’s neighbors lost an add-on room and part of a garage – “They just sort of crumbled,” Tom said.

Another couple ended up walking away, abandoning their home and letting the bank foreclose.

Tom and Kathy had their house reappraised, and it lost more than 40 percent of its value, dropping from $113,000 before the landslide was discovered to $65,000 after.

“It’s like someone put a bomb in your yard,” Tom said.

Sorry, that's not covered by insurance

Cincinnati’s hills are majestic, offering unparalleled views of sunrises, sunsets and the winding Ohio River. But all across this region, homeowners like the Gerreins are waking up to the realization that living among hills comes with risk.

The landslides on Columbia Parkway make news when they snarl rush-hour traffic for a day or two, but they represent just a fraction of the underlying problem and cost.

Much of that cost falls on homeowners, who sometimes don’t realize until it’s too late that landslides generally are not insured.

And, while landslides have always been a problem here, they’re a problem some scientists fear will get worse as climate change causes more weather extremes and dumps more rain onto hillsides in Ohio and Northern Kentucky.

There is no comprehensive landslide database, but University of Kentucky Geologist Matt Crawford has been mapping them for several years, and he has about 80,000 on his list so far.

That’s just in Kentucky.

‘We have to be really careful’

Greater Cincinnati sits in part on what’s called the Kope shale formation, which breaks down easily and is highly prone to landslides.

There is also lakebed clay, a remnant of the glaciers, scattered throughout this region. Lakebed clay shrinks when it’s dry and swells when it gets wet. Too much precipitation adds weight and pressure. The hillsides get oversaturated and, eventually, there’s a landslide.

That geology alone would be enough, said Eric Russo, executive director of The Hillside Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting this region’s hills. But landslides here have been exacerbated by development, Russo said. The hills were stripped of trees and quarried for rock. People built houses and roads, and they didn’t always account for the hills and how they were changing and often damaging them.

""We’ve significantly altered the landscape over the last couple hundred years,"" Russo said. ""In a lot of cases, the hillsides were made weaker.”

And then there’s the rain. Pounding rain. Day after day. It floods the river and, in a way, it floods the hills.

In 1871, the first year the National Weather Service tracked annual precipitation, Cincinnati got 34.5 inches. There were ups and downs from year to year, but from then through 1999, Cincinnati averaged 39.5 inches of precipitation each year.

From 2000 through 2018, the average was 46.4 inches – a 17 percent increase.

Experts caution against using past rainfall amounts as a predictor of any one city’s specific future. Cincinnati could end up with record rainfall while there’s record drought just a few cities away, or vice versa. But, the University of Maryland made a climate-change map that predicts that in 2080, Cincinnati’s climate will feel most like today’s climate near Clarksdale, Mississippi.

That would mean a winter that is 12 degrees warmer on average and 74 percent wetter.

As the earth warms, it means the atmosphere can hold more water, which translates to more precipitation and more intense storms, said Greg Springer, chair of the department of geological sciences at Ohio University.

That combination – added to this area’s already steep terrain – means landslides will “almost certainly become more common,” Springer said.

Mayor John Cranley said there is no question climate change is already affecting landslides on Columbia Parkway, which have shut down the road repeatedly this year. The most obvious fix is a higher retaining wall, but that could cost close to $10 million.

The Hillside Trust doesn’t keep exact counts, but Russo, too, thinks landslides are increasing. These days, he gets five or six calls a week from people who think they might have a slide and aren’t sure what to do.

“It might start getting people to think,” he said, “we have to be really careful about how we’re developing.”

Thirty-nine houses on a slide

Landslides damage is difficult to quantify, but at one point in the ‘80s, Hamilton County had the highest per-capita landslide cost in the country. Experts doubt that has changed much.

From 2015 to present, the Ohio Department of Transportation spent about $295 million on landslide repair.

In Kentucky, the state transportation cabinet spent more than $85 million on landslides in the past five years. That only covers landslides that impacted state roads, to say nothing for the many slides that happened on local roads or private property.

People just don’t think about it, said Crawford, the University of Kentucky geologist. They see a pretty house on a hill, and they buy it. They imagine a future with their family. Planting a garden. Taking long walks. The danger of a landslide – and the lack of insurance coverage under most policies – never crosses their minds.

“Generally, you’re on your own,” Crawford said. “Most people don’t know that, and it’s really, really a burden. I’ve seen a lot of damaged homes and people in bad situations, tragic situations, because of it. And they don’t know who to turn to.”

In Bellevue, Tom and Kathy Gerrein ended up paying nearly $11,000 out of pocket for two studies they sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, asking for help. In 2014, FEMA granted them and the other homeowners a deal to build retaining walls: FEMA would pay for 87 percent of the project and the homeowners would be responsible for the remaining 13.

That federal help is rare – a silver lining to so many homes being at-risk – but it’s been five years since the money was awarded, and not much has been done. Bellevue got a new mayor in January, though, who lamented the lack of progress and said the roughly $2.5 million FEMA project is one of his top priorities. The city isn’t paying for the project since it’s on private property, but it is responsible for overseeing the work since it involves federal money.

“It’s a giant project. It’s just so complicated,” said Mayor Charlie Cleves. But ""it should have been taken care of by now. It’s a lot of homes that are caught up in this thing.”

The Gerrein house has a few cracks now that weren’t there before, and some of the doors don’t close as well as they used to, Tom said. Still, he feels lucky because, despite the major drop in value, he doesn’t think their house has suffered any major structural damage from the landslide.

Every time there’s a period of heavy rain, though, he wonders if their luck will run out. Because the ground is still shifting, and the yard is still dropping.

‘That’s worth more than the house’

This is not just a problem for people who happen to take Columbia Parkway to work or who live at the top of Mount Adams or Price Hill.

This is about a backyard in Oakley that one day was level and the next had a rift about a foot-and-a-half deep.

It’s about a house in Clifton where the front yard cascaded down onto the sidewalk.

It’s about a condo building in East Walnut Hills, where owners pooled their money to build a 150-foot retaining wall after a landslide in February 2018 swept away a chunk of the backyard and crept uncomfortably close to the building.

“We felt like we had to act fast,” said Melanie Millar, a past president of the Husman House homeowners’ association. “We didn’t have a lot of room for losing more land.”

In North Avondale, John Lanzador had no idea anything was wrong until the city came this past summer and cited him for a landslide in his backyard. Lanzador's yard at the top of the hill had slipped and was pushing mud and debris against the neighbors’ houses at the bottom, threatening serious structural damage.

The first estimate was a gut-punch: Half-a-million dollars.

“That’s worth more than the house,” Lanzador said.

Someone suggested he sue his neighbors. If they did something that triggered the slide, maybe they could be held financially liable. But Lanzador hated the thought of that. He didn’t think the landslide was anyone’s fault, and if anything, he wanted to help his neighbors, not face-off in court.

Someone else suggested he go bankrupt. Take the loss and walk away.

That felt wrong, too.

Finally, Lanzador was able to get a lower estimate from a company in West Chester, and he and his neighbors worked out a deal to share the cost. The hill is getting re-sloped, and there will be new retaining walls to protect the homes at the bottom.

Work started in January and was supposed to be finished by now, but it keeps getting delayed by rain. Lanzador hopes it’s done in a couple weeks so he can do his best to forget about it and move on.

It ended up better than what he was initially facing, but it’s still been tough.

“Nobody’s expecting a $100,000 hit,” he said. “I’m just wishing it’s over. Get it done with, and we’ll be OK.”"	pos

Engineers from Leitrim County Council are monitoring the impact of significant mudslides near Drumkeeran, which were caused by heavy rain over the weekend.

Tonnes of peat slid down the Shass Mountain above the Dawn of Hope Bridge, which has been covered and damaged.

Acres of farmland have also been covered by the peat and a number of roads are blocked.

Drumkeeran IFA chairman Tommy Drugan said there are about a dozen farmers affected.

Mr Drugan told RTÉ's News at One that the surrounding lands have been devastated by the displacement of thousands of tonnes of land.

""You'd have to see it to believe it. It is like something out of a movie,"" he said.

He said the big concern now is that if there is more rain, more peat will slide down from the top of the mountain.

""During the day you can monitor what is happening, but at night, if more bog was to move, then it would surround houses. It would have the power to demolish houses.""

Leitrim County Council senior engineer Terence McGovern said it appears that during the recent good weather the bog on the mountain dried out, leaving cracks or fissures.

He said these filled with water during torrential rain at the weekend and the bog started to move on Sunday evening.

Sinn Féin Councillor Padraig Fallon complimented Leitrim County Council staff who have been on site since the start of the incident.

However, he said intervention is needed from the Government, including a hardship fund for the farmers affected.

In a statement this afternoon, Leitrim County Council said it ""continues to assess the situation and monitor the direct impacts. Through this monitoring should emergency actions be identified, appropriate actions will be carried out."""	pos

Here's the latest news on the road.

For the second time this year, a landslide after heavy rains prompted officials to close part of Interstate 40 near the Tennessee-North Carolina state line.

This slide, however, was much smaller than the last, said David Uchiyama, spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Transportation.

Crews responding to the rockslide early Monday afternoon shut down both westbound lanes of I-40 at mile marker 7.5 in Haywood County, North Carolina, after finding three boulders in a ditch beside the road and several more on the mountainside that could pose a danger to motorists, Uchiyama said.

By 5:30 p.m., workers had moved the rocks, and one westbound lane had reopened.

""Traffic sitting in that queue will be allowed through, then traffic stopped at exit 20 will be allowed through,"" Uchiyama said. ""It will remain in a one-lane pattern overnight.""

Experts plan to visit the site Tuesday morning to help determine when the second lane can reopen.

The rockslide follows a much larger landslide in late February, which occurred in the same area and stopped all traffic on I-40 near the state line. The interstate reopened after six days, but traffic was restricted to one lane in each direction for several weeks as crews worked to clear more than 10,000 tons of debris.

After that landslide, workers installed rock anchors and wire mesh along the route, built a retaining wall, resurfaced the road and poured a new concrete median.

Flash floods have killed at least 58, injured dozens and displaced more than 4,000 people in the Indonesian province of Papua, according to disaster officials.

Following heavy rains on Saturday, flash floods hit the town of Sentani, killing 51 and injuring 74, according to Reuters. Nearby, in the provincial capital of Jayapura, seven more were killed when landslides caused by the same rains slammed into homes and swept away residents.

In a message to reporters, Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said, ""The number of casualties and impact of the disaster will likely increase as search and rescue teams are still trying to reach other affected areas.""

Nine houses were washed away in Sentani, Nugroho said.

As the water begins to recede, officials are still trying to evacuate people. ""The joint search and rescue teams are still doing evacuations, and not all affected areas have been reached, because of fallen trees, rocks, mud and other material,"" Nugroho said, according to Agence France-Presse.

Nugroho posted videos online that showed waters rushing through streets and town centers. After daybreak, online videos showed rescuers and residents clambering through debris. In one video, an airplane with a damaged nose and propellers lay in the mud.

""Our house was flooded with thick mud. ... We immediately grabbed our valuables and ran to a neighbor's house to seek refuge. ... It's hard to get out of the area because many roads are blocked. ... I'm worried, sad and scared all at one time,"" Lilis Puji Hastuti, a 29-year-old mother of two young children in Sentani, told Agence France-Presse.

Suryadi Diaz, a Papua police spokesman, told The New York Times that the flooding was exacerbated by the cutting of trees in the hills above Sentani — part of an effort to convert the land for farming. Diaz said the lack of vegetation meant there was little in the mountainous region to slow the flash floods or landslides.

Flooding in Indonesia is common during the rainy season, which lasts from October through April. Earth magazine reports:

""Few people outside the region understand just how regularly natural disasters occur throughout Indonesia's 5,000-kilometer-wide archipelago. More than 2,000 serious disasters are reported each year, 90 percent of which are weather-related — mostly the result of flooding rains, tornadoes, fires and mudslides. In 2017, Indonesians reported 787 floods, 716 tornadoes, 614 landslides, and 96 forest and ground fires (burning peat lands and rainforests to make room for large palm oil plantations and smaller farms is a popular practice, especially in Sumatra).""

Papua, Indonesia's easternmost province, occupies the western half of the island of New Guinea. The region is rich in natural resources, but the poverty rates there are some of the highest in the country. As Time reported, despite its reputation as Indonesia's ""land of gold,"" Papua is the country's ""poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia."""	neg

It’s not yet clear what the fix will be, but councilman Christopher Smitherman introduced a motion that would declare the landslides an emergency, freeing up the city to use “whatever capital dollars (are) necessary” to stabilize the hill.

Smitherman introduced the motion during a Law and Public Safety committee meeting. The retaining wall along the parkway is failing, he said, and properties at the top of the hill are at risk.

He said his goal is to give the city administration a green light to start weighing potential solutions.

“We want them to fix this, and we want them to make it a priority,” he said. “People’s homes might slide down the hill. … There are people that are in homes, they’re very, very worried. If I lived there, I would be worried.”

'Like someone put a bomb in your yard':Landslides in Greater Cincinnati are bad. And they'll probably get worse.

Help us report the story:Have you experienced a landslide in Greater Cincinnati?

Landslides have long been a plague on the Cincinnati region, but this has been an especially rough year. And, scientists say the situation will likely worsen with global warming.

Columbia Parkway, in particular, has been regularly shut down by slides. One potential fix is to build a new retaining wall along the parkway, but a recent city memo shows that could cost close to $10 million.

It is one of the city's busier roads. A 2015 traffic count from the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council of Governments shows one portion of the parkway getting nearly 35,000 vehicles a day. Another stretch, farther east of Downtown, shows just over 26,000 vehicles a day.

Councilman Jeff Pastor said he’s not only concerned for homeowners but for drivers.

“It’s almost daily or weekly, every time there’s a severe weather event, that we have a mudslide now,” he said. “My concern is for the travelers… Someone is driving, and here comes a mudslide. I think we have to get this wall fixed.”

City officials will give an update on the Columbia Parkway landslide situation on Tuesday during the Major Projects & Smart Government committee meeting. That will take place at 1 p.m. in council chambers.

“I think it is absolutely critical that we get this thing fixed as soon as humanly possible,” said Councilman Greg Landsman, who chairs that committee and requested the update.

Columbia Parkway is “a critical artery that continues to be undermined by these landslides,” Landsman said. “It’s very much reflective of where we are in terms of our disinvestment in critical infrastructure.”"	neg

ALOR SETAR, Aug 20 — The incident in the Gunung Jerai area that resulted in mudslides and floods on Wednesday was not caused by the water surge phenomenon but is attributed to a debris flow incident which is a common occurrence in mountainous areas.

Principal Research Fellow at Institute for Environment and Development (Lestari), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) Prof Emeritus Datuk Dr Ibrahim Komoo said a debris flow is a more accurate description for the incident due to abnormally heavy rainfall in the area.

He said water surges occur when an unusually high volume of rainfall flows into the riverbeds which are interrupted due to sediments and debris, causing the water level to go up several metres.

“Meanwhile a debris flow formed when water is mixed with soil and forests debris that move rapidly downwards entering the riverbeds until it reaches the foothill,” he told Bernama today.

On Wednesday, the area around Gunung Jerai was hit by mudslides and landslides due to a sudden rush of water which resulted in four deaths with two victims still missing.

The disaster caused damages to properties and facilities as well as affected residents in the town nearby as it became inundated with mud.

Ibrahim said the incident would take a long time to recur as the area has been cleared of debris such as fallen trees that would result in an uninterrupted flow of rainwater.

He said a similar incident had happened before in Pos Dipang, Perak in 1996 which destroyed an Orang Asli village and killed 44 people.

“An almost similar incident happened at Genting Sempah in 1995 that killed many people.

He added that it was a natural phenomenon and had nothing to do with logging activities.

Environmental hydrologist and river modelling expert Prof Datuk Dr Mohd Ekhwan Toriman said satellite images did not detect any logging or large-scale agricultural activities in the Gunung Jerai area.

He said water surges due to rainfall would bring with it wood debris, stones and silts which would cause mud floods up to 1.5 metres deep at the foothills.

He speculated that the Gunung Jerai incident was probably caused by debris that had accumulated and formed a dam in the upper reaches of the river, adding that an abnormally heavy rainfall collected more debris and became stuck in the natural dam.

“High pressure had caused the dam to break, bringing with it debris, rocks, wood debris, sediments and silts,” he said.

He said rainfall distribution at the rainfall stations in Gunung Jerai and Kampung Singkir Genting recorded 218 millimetres (mm) and 172 mm of rainwater during the incident.

Meanwhile, Institute of Geology Malaysia (IGM) president Abd Rasid Jaapar in a statement said a thorough study and action plan must be developed utilising the concept of disaster risk reduction in line with good international practices as outlined by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR).

He said a complete and independent geology disaster study should be carried out in Gunung Jerai and the surrounding area. ― AFP"	pos

Officials said more than 12,000 people had fled their homes in the southwest province of Bengkulu as a result of the disaster, which has also claimed the lives of more than 200 cows, goats and sheep.

Hundreds of buildings, schools, bridges and roads have been damaged, hindering efforts of search and rescue teams and aid workers to reach the affected areas. Two sub-districts were completely cut off by landslides.

The Indonesia Disaster Agency said the flooding had started to subside in some parts of the province but warned that the death toll could get worse.

“The impact of this disaster may increase,” said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. “Landslides and floods could happen again if rainfall is high.

Four others were injured across the province and rescuers are trying to track down 13 missing people, according to an official report posted by the agency on Monday morning.

Flooding in parts of the capital of Jakarta also left two people dead and more than 2,000 temporarily homeless earlier in the week.

Fourteen pythons escaped from a private property in the nearby city of Bogor after a nearby river overflowed. Six were recaptured but officials warned residents to “be alert”.

The disaster agency said refugee tents, rubber boats, blankets, ready-to-eat food, clean water, baby equipment and emergency lights were all needed, in addition to equipment to repair road and bridge links.

More than 2/3 of one portion the Old Pali Road is missing. It crumbled, landing on the Pali Highway below. The initial rockslide came down on February 18, 2019 forcing the highway to close.

Standing near portion of the Old Pali Road that collapsed, you can see the rebar sticking out of what’s left of the concrete wall.

Rocks of all sizes continue to fall from up above.

One member of the crew is tasked with watching for falling rocks. When he sees one, he blows a horn warning everyone to take cover. The KHON2 crew was told to move as close to the mountainside as possible if the horn blows.

Workers are secured, clipped into the rockwall, several of them dangling by ropes. They are stabilizing the mountainside and are constantly battling the elements.

KHON: “How dangerous is this? How many hours a day are they doing this, and in what kind of conditions?”

“I can’t say enough about the crews from Prometheus,” Tim Sakahara said from the department of transportation. “This is difficult right now with the wind just standing here. But yet, these guys are rappeling down the slope, working hammering 12 hours a day, seven days a week.”

They are pounding in reinforcing rebar to secure the protective fence meant to catch any falling rocks or other debris. The fence will make is safer down below where crews are busy clearing large boulders and other massive piles of dirt and concrete. Earlier this week, the pile of rubble was so high it was almost as tall as the tunnel.

Workers on site said that the pile of debris extends 20 feet into the tunnel. They also said they’ve hauled out at least 16 truck-loads of debris each day since Monday. They’re expecting to have everything cleared up in the next three days.

“Once that is done, that’s when the crews can come in and start building the tunnel structure itself that extends out over the Pali lanes and the highway,” Sakahara said.

That will protect drivers and cars from future rockfalls and mudslides.

“There will be future landslides. Even once this work is done, it doesn’t mean there’s not going to be a landslide again in the future,” Sakahara explained.

Crews even pointed a stress-crack in the mountainside directly over the slope that is being repaired.

Sakahara said that crews are doing what they can to mitigate the problem.

The department of transportation said the work stabilizing the mountainside should be completed by the end of April and crews are expected to have the new tunnel built by the end of August."	pos

It was filled with everything: cars, trees, animals. And they were all just rushing by.

This had happened before in a different town in Minas Gerais about five years ago, but I never imagined it could happen here. A few months before the mudslide, the people from Vale had told us the dam posed no risk. That was in September, and by January it was broken. I remember hearing the sound of helicopters coming from the mines about twenty minutes after the break, and my heart fell to my chest because my sons were working in the mines.

It was my youngest, Caio César, who I was most worried about. The mudslide happened at noon, and normally he would be having lunch at a restaurant right where the mudslide went through. Somehow, on that day, by the grace of God, he decided to go for lunch an hour later than usual. It was a miracle, is all I can say."	neg

The Camogli cemetery, built more than 100 years ago, is situated along an area of rocky seaside cliffs. Francesco Olivari, the mayor of Camogli, called the collapse an “unimaginable catastrophe.”

It is estimated that 200 coffins had fallen, but only 10 have been recovered, according to Giacomo Giampedrone, regional assessor of civil protection. Recovering the rest of them “will depend on the sea in the coming days,” he added.









On Saturday, maintenance being performed along the area of fragile coastline was abruptly stopped when workers noticed cracks in the rock.

A team of geologists with the department is using drones to get a better sense of the damage and determine if there is danger of another.

Port officials closed a section of the coast below the cemetery to keep the coffins from floating out to sea.

Three sections of the state's most popular trail are buried under tons of boulders, rock and dirt from the steep, stony slopes of the Owens Peak ridgeline, approximately eight miles north of Walker Pass in Kern County.

The buried section can't be traveled by horseback, north of Walker Pass, where the trail crosses State Route 178 near Lake Isabella. Hikers are urged to use extreme caution when traversing the rocky terrain, as the unstable rocks can shift at any time, authorities said.

Debris removal from the 100-foot rockslide will begin in late September. There is no timeframe for when the trail will be cleared and the hillside stabilized, the bureau stated.

Seismic activity continues in the area and recreationists may experience more rockfalls and hazards along the trail and farther north for roughly 20 miles.

To avoid the 25-mile damaged Owens Peak section, southbound hikers can exit the trail at the Chimney Creek Campground via car by taking Canebrake Road, also known as the Chimney Peak Backcountry Byway, eastward to State Route 178 to get back on the trail at Walker Pass.

The Pacific Crest Trail spans the highest portion of the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range, stretching 2,650 miles from the U.S.–Mexico border to the U.S. –Canada border, passing through 25 national forests and seven national parks in California, Oregon and Washington.

Every year, hundreds of thousands of hikers use the trail — portions of which run through Tulare County and Kings Canyon National Park.

Few actually complete the country-spanning trek.

The Pacific Crest Trail was designated by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. The long-distance hiking and equestrian trail was not officially completed until 1993.

Many locals had only recently rebuilt their homes in a district that since the earthquake has emerged as one of Nepal’s most vulnerable to landslides. Nepal is also being battered by an economic crisis and widespread unemployment brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has left 336 people dead in the country.

As many as 20 people from the village of Barhabise were missing on Sunday after the landslides, which washed away 28 homes in the region on Saturday night, leaving rescuers racing to find survivors and dig them out.

“Rescuers are working hard, but rescuing the missing people alive seems impossible,” said Shreedhar Neupane, a press secretary to the speaker of Nepal’s House of Representatives, Agni Prasad Sapkota."	pos
51	160	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/29/canada-salmon-fraser-river-british-columbia	Canada: workers race to free millions of salmon trapped after huge landslide	2019-08-29 00:00:00	"Helicopters, heavy machinery and nearly 200 workers are frantically working to free millions of salmon trapped by a landslide in western Canada.

Government crews in the area have worked relentlessly along the banks of the Fraser River to clear debris after a rockslide, discovered in a late June, created an impassable 5m-high waterfall.

Each year, several species of Pacific salmon – sockeye, chinook, pink and coho – travel up British Columbia’s Fraser River to reproduce. But the newly formed barrier has blocked the fish from accessing critical watersheds for egg laying.

Weeks of excavation have shown success: already, 12,000 salmon have passed through carefully constructed channels. And 44,000 salmon – as many as 3,000 per day – have been transported by helicopter.

“Nothing is off the table unless it’s determined as not being feasible. We are looking at any and all options,” Michael Crowe of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, told reporters on Wednesday. The team hopes to continue moving fish by truck, after the road was rebuilt, as well as developing a fish ladder.

Emergency crews have leaned heavily on local Indigenous communities, and their knowledge of salmon spawning, to help gather tens of thousands of fish.

“First Nations’ technical knowledge in fish capture – from beach-seining crews to a second fish wheel – underpins the operation,” said the government in a media release.

Muddy, fast-moving water has made it difficult for officials to estimate the number of salmon trapped below the landslide site. In previous years, said Crowe, millions of salmon would be passing through this section of the Fraser River. A number of fish have been outfitted with radio tracking collars in order to give a clearer picture of how many have successfully moved upstream.

The landslide, and the frantic effort to clear it, highlights the barriers – natural and human-made – that salmon face each year.

In much of western North America, hydroelectric dams have blocked critical spawning routes. In recent years, the plight of displaced salmon has prompted increasingly dramatic attempts to move the fish, including the “salmon cannon” – footage of which recently went viral.

The efforts in British Columbia to free the trapped salmon comes amid a difficult times for the fish: recent data suggests sockeye salmon have plummeted 75% over the last century in Canada. Last week, the department of fisheries and oceans confirmed the dire state of sockeye when it warned only 600,000 were expected to spawn this year, as apposed to the normal return of five million. Chinook salmon, which are also stranded in the river, are also endangered."	pos

On Tuesday, the Oregon Department of Transportation tweeted, roads outside of the coastal town of Brookings turned into warped and jagged chunks of asphalt after a landslide stripped away the sediment beneath Highway 101.

US 101 remains closed at MP 344, 12 mi north of #Brookings. This is a chronic trouble spot on US 101, which shifted abruptly yesterday.

It's not a viable detour route for any trucks. #HooskanadanSlide pic.twitter.com/NOZZY26OlZ — Oregon DOT (@OregonDOT) February 26, 2019

According to ODOT, the landslide occurred 12 miles outside of Brookings at a ""chronic trouble spot on US 101.""

A drone video captured yesterday by Brookings, Ore.-based road-repair company Tidewater Contractors shows the impressive extent of the damage done by the heavy rain.

Dan Latham, an ODOT spokesperson, told The Oregonian that this is the largest landslide the agency has seen since 2005 or 2006. But as climate change leads to more extreme weather events, researchers at Oregon State University say this is likely to become the new normal.

A new study from the university's College of Engineering and College of Forestry says landslides on unstable slopes along the Oregon coast could increase by 30 percent in coming years.

""If we see increased extreme events like storm surge, then we'll see increased bluff erosion,"" one of the study's authors, Ben Leshchinsky, a forest engineering and civil engineering researcher at OSU, says in a statement. ""These creeping landslides that are already active and moving every year, they'll move a lot more. If erosion increases 10 percent, slide movements might increase by 20 or 30 percent.""

Increases in groundwater levels drive landslides like the one that occurred on Highway 101, the report noes, but seaside cliffs that are eroding rapidly as they are hit with increasingly powerful waves could also do serious damage.

""As a bluff's toe erodes, the soil in the bluff shifts gradually,"" the report says, ""sometimes ending in collapses that can topple houses and bury roads such as Highway 101, which runs the length of the Oregon coast.""

Leshchinsky says the erosion is often imperceptible, as it occurs underground, and is made worse by climate change. He adds that research is crucial ""especially considering estimates of future sea level rise and possible changes in the magnitude and frequency of coastal storms.""

Leshchinsky and his colleagues suggest stabilizing dunes with vegetation, walls, cobbles and boulders.

""If we can decrease erosion,"" he says, ""then for some of the smaller slides, we could, potentially, arrest or slow slide movement significantly."""	neg

The jade hub of Hpakant, in Kachin State in the north of the north of the country, is frequently hit by deadly accidents, despite government pledges to clean up the lucrative mining industry.

In April, 55 mining company employees were killed when a pond up a slope from where they were digging breached its banks, leading authorities to suspended 17 mining blocks over safety concerns.

The police chief in the area, Than Win Aung, told Reuters from the accident site that 14 bodies had been recovered and four people, two of them policeman who were guarding the mining site, were missing and feared dead.

“We were able to rescue two members of the police who only injured their heads, and sent them to hospital,” he said.

One policeman was confirmed dead, he said.

The government has ordered all mining activity in Hpakant to cease during Myanmar’s May-October monsoon season, but people in the area say scavengers still scour tailing piles for jade.

“The companies aren’t operating because of the water,” said Than Win Aung. “Security people are on duty in order to prevent landslides due to illegal mining.”

Yau Dau, 25, who lives next to the mining site, said the landslide happened after midnight.

“I was still awake. The sound of the landslide was really frightening. I thought we’re gone ... our house was shaking,” he said.

Official sales of jade in Myanmar were worth 671 million euros ($750.04 million) in 2016-17, according to the most recent data published by the government as part of an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

But analysts believe the true value of the industry, which mainly exports to China, is much larger."	pos

Starting at 5 a.m., the state contraflowed Kailua-bound lanes to be used for town-bound commuters. The contraflow lasted until 9 a.m. with no major problems reported.

The partial reopening was aimed at easing gridlock after a landslide on Monday forced the closure of both directions of the major thoroughfare. On Wednesday, officials acknowledged it “could be months” before Honolulu-bound lanes of the highway reopen.

The morning contraflow will continue until further notice. The state will also change direction of the lanes for the afternoon commute.

Here’s how the contraflow will work:

Kaneohe-bound lanes of the Pali Highway will be used for town-bound commuters.

The morning contraflow will run from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m.

In the afternoons, starting at 3 p.m., Kaneohe-bound lanes will be used for Kaneohe-bound traffic.

For now, the afternoon contraflow will run from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. and then the highway will be closed again.

Ed Sniffen, state Transportation Department deputy director for highways, said the contraflow was the best ― and only ― short-term solution to ease traffic for Windward Oahu commuters.

“We just want to make sure that when we open this up, we’re very cautious about it,"" he said, in a news conference Thursday. “I wish I had better news for everybody.”

The problems started Monday, when multiple landslides sent SUV-sized boulders and mounds of debris onto first the Kailua-bound and then the Honolulu-bound lanes of the highway, sending three people to the hospital.

In the days that followed, the situation worsened.

Overnight, large rocks continued to rain down onto the town-bound lanes, and the landslides also damaged portions of Old Pali Road, leaving slabs of concrete perched precariously overhead.

Sniffen said officials are considering several options to stabilize the hillsides above the townbound lanes, including “structural solutions” that could be built on site.

“We’re re-looking at the options here,” he said.

He added the contraflow “may go on for months” to provide needed capacity in the mornings and afternoons.

The Pali Highway sees about 50,000 vehicles per day, and bringing the two lanes on the highway back into service are “going to be big” for easing congestion, Sniffen said.

On Wednesday morning, the highway closure continued to snarl traffic for Windward Oahu drivers, adding a half an hour or more to drive times.

“It was very slow coming through,” said Kahaluu resident Brad Cooper.

He added that even though he left his home early Tuesday, the drive to town that usually takes him 25 minutes still took more than a hour using the Likelike Highway.

The heavy traffic on the major roadways overflowed onto side streets.

“We didn’t even actually get on the highway. It was just the road that sits next to the highway so it was much longer than anticipated,” said Honolulu resident Ann Miller.

Authorities said there were at least two separate landslides Monday, which came after a weekend of heavy rains.

The more serious landslide was into the Honolulu-bound lanes and happened about 6 p.m.

Authorities said a 43-year-old woman sustained serious injuries from falling debris, paramedics said. Two children, ages 9 and 2, were also taken to a hospital in stable condition.

About an hour earlier, a landslide came down onto Kailua-bound lanes.

The last landslide onto the Pali Highway was in August, and following that incident, the state ordered specialized impact fencing for the area. But that fencing would no longer work for the hillside, Sniffen said.

This is the 23rd quake to jolt the northeastern state in the last five weeks.

The quake on Friday occurred at 11.16 am and the epicentre was 29 km southeast of Champhai, the NCS said.

The earthquake and heavy rains caused landslides at several places in the district, Champhai Deputy Commissioner Maria CT Zuali told PTI.

She said two buildings have been vacated and the water supply pipeline to Dungtlang village was damaged due to landslides.

The quantum of damage is yet to be ascertained as officials are assessing it, Zuali added

Many people have set up makeshift tents and camps, and are sleeping outside their houses spooked by frequent quakes.

The district administration has provided them tarpaulins, water tanks, solar lamps, first aid kits and eatables, according to officials.

A series of earthquakes have hit the state since June 18 with remote Champhai being the worst-affected.

Earthquakes have also rocked Saitual, Serchhip and Siaha districts.

Earlier in the day, newly elected Rajya Sabha member from Mizoram K Vanlalvena, who is at present in the national capital, called on the secretary at the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences, M Rajeevan, and asked him to send a team to the state.

Speaking to PTI from New Delhi, Vanlalvena said he urged the ministry to send seismologists to assess the cause of the frequent earthquakes.

He said the secretary told him that they were taking the earthquakes in Mizoram seriously and would put forward the matter before higher authorities.

(Source: Special Arrangement)

At least 21 persons were killed, including children, in a series of rain-induced landslides that took place in three districts of southern Assam’s Barak Valley—Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi—on Tuesday morning.

The incidents come on the heels of the first wave of floods, which displaced lakhs in the state in the past week.

Condoling the deaths, President Ramnath Kovind tweeted, “The loss of lives due to heavy rains and landslides in Barak valley, Assam is tragic. Local authorities are undertaking rescue and relief efforts. Condolences to the bereaved families. Prayers for everyone’s safety and well-being.”

Earlier in the day, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal had said that he was “deeply anguished” at the loss of lives in Barak valley. The government has dispatched teams for rescue and relief operations to the spots.

Deeply anguished at the loss of lives due to landslides triggered by incessant rain in Barak valley. I have directed Cachar, Hailakandi & Karimganj district administrations and SDRF to step up rescue, relief operations and facilitate all possible help needed to those affected. — Sarbananda Sonowal (@sarbanandsonwal) June 2, 2020

As per officials at the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, Cachar district has reported 7 deaths (4 children, 3 adults) in the Lakhipur revenue circle, Karimganj district has reported 6 deaths (3 children, 3 adults) in the Nilambazar Revenue Circle and Hailakandi district has reported 8 deaths (6 adults, 2 children) in the Hailakandi revenue circle.

CM Sonowal wrote further in his tweet: “I have directed Cachar, Hailakandi & Karimganj district administrations and SDRF to step up rescue, relief operations and facilitate all possible help needed to those affected.” The CM also directed the respective district administrations to immediately release ex-gratia to the next of kin of the deceased.

“Most of the houses were make-shift and located near a hillock. We have been witnessing continuous rainfall in the last 3-4 days but last night it was particularly heavy,” said a district official from Hailakandi, adding that the victims belonged to two families.

In Cachar district too, the houses were located under a hillock. “The rains caused the soil to loosen and resulted in landslides which destroyed the houses,” said an official from Cachar district, who wished to remain anonymous. “We had a record-breaking 150 mm of rainfall last night — it was unprecedented.”

About 12 hours after the landslide, the Myanmar Fire Services Department said it had recovered 162 bodies and that 54 people who were injured had been taken to the hospital for treatment. The death toll makes the disaster the worst known in the jade mining industry, surpassing an accident in 2015 that killed 113 people.

""The jade miners were smothered by a wave of mud, which hit after heavy rainfall,"" the Fire Service said, according to The Associated Press. Reuters says the victims were mostly ""jade pickers"" — people who sift through tailings to scavenge small bits of the semi-precious stone.

The landslide occurred in Kachin state, about 600 miles north of the country's largest city, Yangon. Kachin is the center of the world's most lucrative jade-mining industry. Myanmar's jade industry was estimated to be worth $31 billion in 2014.

Video posted to social media showed miners racing uphill to escape the avalanche of mud.

Maung Khaing, a 38-year-old miner from the area who witnessed the accident, told Reuters that he was about to take a photo of the precarious waste mound that he felt was set to collapse when people began shouting ""run, run!""

""Within a minute, all the people at the bottom (of the hill) just disappeared,"" he told Reuters by phone.

""I still have goose bumps,"" he said. ""There were people stuck in the mud shouting for help but no one could help them.""

According to Reuters, a local official had warned people not to go to the mine on Thursday because of heavy rain."	pos

Almost a year after damage from record rainfall and flooding forced its closure, Aina Haina Public Library reopened Tuesday. Read more

Almost a year after damage from record rainfall and flooding forced its closure, Aina Haina Public Library reopened Tuesday.

The flooding was caused by thunderstorms from April 13 to 16 that triggered landslides and road closures on Kauai and East Oahu, and prompted President Donald Trump to issue a major disaster declaration.

At the Aina Haina library, the deluge caused major water damage from front to back and soaked the flooring in muddy water, according to Mallory Fujitani, special assistant to the state librarian of the Hawaii State Public Library System.

“I thought, ‘There’s no way that library is going to be open tomorrow,’” Cathy Gold, board member of Friends of Aina Haina Library, recalled. “It was unbelievable. … We didn’t expect it to be closed for so long.”

A nanny for an Aina Haina family said she would bring her client’s 2-year-old to the library at least twice a week and was disappointed when it had to be closed for repairs.

A mother who brought her 1-year-old to the library for the first time at the reopening said she wanted to come every day.

“It’s really spacious and kid-friendly,” Sheena Sumi­moto said of the newly renovated space.

Improvements included new flooring, furniture, repainting of the interior and exterior, and updated bathrooms.

The update cost about $650,000. About $350,000 was allocated for flood repairs, and $300,000 was from an existing contract to redo the bathrooms.

After the work was completed, over 80 volunteers from Aina Haina Prepared and Friends of Aina Haina Library spent over 270 hours unpacking and restocking 1,700 boxes of items, Fujitani said. Among those volunteers was Tommy Waters, a candidate for the District 4 seat in the Honolulu City Council.

The library reopened at 1 p.m. with a blessing from the Rev. Christoper Bridges of Episcopal Church of the Holy Nativity. Celebrations continued into the evening with live performances by ukulele virtuosos Jake Shimabukuro and Taimane Gardner.

The library will be the third to launch an ukulele-­lending program hosted by the Music for Life Foundation. When it launches within the next few months, the public will be able to borrow ukulele as they would books, and take ukulele lessons at the library. Nanakuli Public Library and Waimanalo Public Library already have ukulele-lending programs.

Last year’s flooding around Aina Haina was partly due to the overflowing of Wailupe Stream, which had been blocked by build-up of debris higher in the watershed that was brought down, according to city officials. The blockage caused the water to build up and overrun its banks instead of flowing freely.

Waters expressed concern about current flood mitigation efforts in the area.

“They built a couple dams within the stream, and that’s troubling to me because I thought the problem was that the water couldn’t free-flow down to the ocean because of all of the debris,” Waters said. “Just from a common-sense point of view, it doesn’t make sense.”

He said he’s reached out to city officials but has yet to hear back.

Correction: Clarification: An earlier version of this story said Wailupe stream’s flooding last year was mostly due to poor maintenance, which some residents contend. City officials, however, say that it was due to debris build-up in the stream."	pos

Crews have placed concrete barriers bolted together as a quick fix to stop mudslides from blocking the road during Monday's storm.

Drivers are happy with the temporary solution, which will save them from having to detour all the way around the road if it lasts through the storm.

""For what I gotta do, it's the best thing to happen, you know?"" said Eric Zalaya.

Earlier this month, the last atmospheric river turned Hicks Rd. into a rocky, soupy mess. Now, a large chunk of the steep, muddy hill is gone, exposing a layer of more stable rocky shale. There are some trees that cling right on the edge of the hillside with exposed roots.

Santa Clara County hopes the barriers will hold the hillside through the onslaught of Monday's storm.

""Once this last storm rolls through, probably a month to let it dry completely out. We'll go out there and clean everything up and be able to give them the whole road back,"" said Dan Pendergraft of Santa Clara County Roads.

Crews in the South Bay were also making progress on another major shutdown after installing vertical piles to reinforce the road. However, the continued rain has made it difficult to give an accurate estimate on the opening.

Three weeks ago, the ground below the road started to give way, in what's known as a ""slipout."" After nearly a month of posted warning signs, media coverage and closures on Google Maps, drivers are still trying to pass through, only to get frustrated and disappointed.

One driver trying to reach her grandchildren in Palo Alto told KPIX 5 she had to take a 27 mile detour; she looped back around onto Highway 9, then to Highway 85 before finally driving onto Highway 280.

As for the reopening of Highway 35, the best estimate officials had was for one lane to be open at the end of February, but that likely will not happen until early or mid-March.

Five people have died and dozens are missing after heavy rains triggered a series of landslides in eastern Uganda's mountainous Bududa district, the Red Cross said on Wednesday.

The organisation said that around 50 people were believed missing and 150 houses destroyed after the landslides on Tuesday night in the foothills of Mount Elgon -- an extinct volcano with five major peaks.

""Five confirmed dead,"" said Uganda Red Cross spokeswoman Irene Nakasiita, adding these included a 73-year-old woman and several children.

""There were multiple landslides,"" in Bududa district, ""but for now Red Cross has concentrated in the worst hit areas"", she said in a statement.

""The local Red Cross branch volunteers together with the local police joined efforts and retrieved the bodies.

""The affected areas have steep slopes. It is threatening to rain again (and) accessibility is still a challenge,"" she added.

HIGH RISK

Local lawmaker Godfrey Watenga told AFP the landslides had taken place late on Tuesday evening.

""It is a tragic occurrence. Many people are said to be dead and many missing but we are trying to get the details as the terrain here is difficult to manoeuvre and get to the affected villages.""

Bududa district, which lies on the border between Uganda and Kenya, is a high risk area for landslides.

In 2018 at least 41 people were killed after a river in the region burst its banks, and in 2010 at least 100 people were killed in a landslide.

PAST CASES

A statement from the office of Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda said that ""there are reports of displacement and destruction of property as well as missing persons.""

After the 2010 landslide, the government said that the region, where people live on extremely steep slopes, was too dangerous to be lived in and that a programme was under way to re-locate residents.

However similar disasters claimed lives in 2011, 2012 and 2016."	pos

“This year’s flood is the worst in my life,” U Zaw Zaw Htoo, a member of Parliament from Paung Township in Mon State, which includes the area devastated by the landslide, said on Sunday.

Thirty inches of water drowned the township on Thursday and Friday, he said. The torrential rainfall in Mon State, a finger of land stretching down Myanmar’s coast, is expected to continue over the next couple of days.

Nearly 30 houses in Thaphyu Kone village in Mon State were completely buried by mud, officials said. And as he supervised rescue efforts in Thaphyu Kone, Ko Bo Bo Win, a community activist, said he worried that the crowds of onlookers who had gathered could be swept away by another landslide.

“It’s heartbreaking to see the dead bodies,” he added.

Ma Htay Htay, a resident of Thaphyu Kone, said she had just left for work on Friday when she heard a roaring noise behind her. Turning around, she saw her house disappear under mud.

Eight members of her family are missing, she said on Sunday, adding, “I’m praying hard that I will see them alive, but I don’t really have hope.”

More than 105,000 people across Myanmar have been displaced because of flooding since June, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs."	pos

The dreadful landslide disaster last month in northern India has served to highlight, very clearly, the threat posed by poor awareness of slope issues in the Hindu Kush Himalayas. Regular readers will be bored of my repeatedly making the point that we are failing to adequately consider, or manage, these threats across a range of human activities as development continues apace.

In Uttarakhand there is another very major infrastructure project, alongside the hydroelectric schemes that we so badly damaged on 7 February, that is also leading to substantial levels of loss. This is the Char Dham project, a road widening scheme of sufficient magnitude that it has its own Wikipedia entry:

Char Dham National Highway (Hindi: चार धाम महामार्ग), is an under construction two-lane (in each direction) express National Highway with a minimum width of 10 metres in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The under construction highway will complement the under-construction Char Dham Railway by connecting the four holy places in Uttarakhand states namely Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. The project includes 900 km national highways which will connect whole of Uttarakhand state.

I am not against the development of infrastructure in high mountain areas, indeed quite the opposite, but these zones are fragile. These roads have the potential to be a vital lifeline, but they also have the potential to create untold havoc. Unfortunately, there are growing concerns about the latter, caused by poor alignment selection, engineering design and construction practise. In particular, there is clear evidence that the road widening is causing slope instability on a grand scale. Reports suggest that data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has indicated that there are at least 161 major slope failures along the alignment, with more expected due to poor construction practises and the removal of trees. Bizarrely, a committee of the Supreme Court in India that has been investigating the project appears to be split, releasing two reports, one of which favours continuing with a 10 m wide road bench, the other indicating that it should be narrowed to 7 m.

There is an interesting article on the environmental costs of the Char Dham project on the First Post website, which includes this horrifying picture:

.

SANDRP also has a good article about this project.

Whilst the Char Dham project is undoubtedly important both strategically and in development terms, it is undeniable that the practises shown above are deeply problematic. Their legacy is likely to last for a long time."	pos

Twenty-three people were killed, including cat owner Josie Gower. The devastation of the debris flow was so terrible that the bodies of two victims were never found.

The ASAP shelter says Patches was found less than a quarter-mile from where her Montecito home stood.

She was reunited with Gower’s partner, Norm Borgatello, on New Year’s Eve.

“Though we don’t know exactly what she’s been doing with her life for the past three years, we can see that both Patches and Norm are thrilled to be reunited,” the shelter said in a Facebook post.

The closure of Pali Highway due to multiple landslides is affecting foot traffic for some Kailua businesses, but mostly it’s an inconvenience for those who live and work in the area.

“We’ve had a lot less tourists come through. For the most part, we haven’t seen as many tourist buses or tourists in general,” said Shelby Mitchell, a manager at SoHa Living in Kailua, adding that the decrease in traffic, however, “hasn’t really impacted sales too much.”

Mitchell said she feels the impact in another way.

“I live in town, so I have to deal with the commute. I know it’s difficult because it takes pretty much an hour each way now” as opposed to half an hour, she said.

That’s why the state Department of Transportation reopened the Pali to one-way traffic from 5 to 9 a.m., helping to ease morning traffic to Honolulu.

“The contra-flow this morning went really, really well,” said DOT spokesman Tim Sakahara on Thursday. “All morning I was getting texts and calls from people saying thank you. It definitely made a huge difference in the morning commute for people. Traffic flowed very smoothly not only on the Pali, but the Likelike and H-3 as well.”

The DOT, which expects the shutdown to last months as state crews fortify the unstable slopes near the Pali Highway tunnels, is also opening the contra-flow lane in the afternoon from 3 to 7 p.m. for Windward-bound traffic only.

“People are going to be upset,” said Michaela Kemna, a personal stylist at Fighting Eel in Kailua, of the months-long closure. “People from Kailua this side go through Hawaii Kai to town instead of going through the Pali now. Traffic’s awful in Hawaii Kai.”

“It’s definitely an inconvenience for anyone who has to work here or lives on this side,” added Fighting Eel employee Emi Santiago. “I don’t think anyone is going to go out of the way to come down here.”

Nadia Ribeiro, owner of swimsuit shop Brazilian Show Room, said it took her almost two hours to get to Kailua from her Kahala home in the early afternoon. She said the highway shutdown is “worrisome.”

“Whoever needs to come to Kailua, they’re not going to come because of that,” she said.

Greg Young, a manager for Maui Brewing Co., was more optimistic.

“You might lose a little bit of that tourist traffic coming from town, but in general … the sunshine’s out — it hasn’t been out for couple days — so I think everybody’s at the beach,” he said. “I think they’re still out and about, and they’re finding a way to get here.”

Kuulei Neher, a sales associate at Bikinibird, said sales over the past few days were down but are almost back to normal.

The Maunawili resident works in Kailua and is a senior at Punahou School, so commuting back and forth is “really difficult.”

“It’s already been difficult going on the Likelike, especially because I live at the bottom of the Pali, so it’s like super irritating,” Neher said, adding that it is taking her about 40 minutes instead of 20 minutes to get to school. “I actually spent the night at my auntie’s house in town — the past three nights — because of just the craziness ’cause I didn’t want to have to deal with it. Some of my friends who live in Kailua and go to school at Punahou, it took them two hours to get to school. It’s just unfortunate like how one highway can affect so many people’s lives, not even just the Kailua people, but everyone in town as well ’cause it causes more traffic. I just hope they get it done as quickly as possible.”"	pos

Two girls, ages 2 and 9, were also in the truck and taken to the hospital but were not injured, Enright said.

The Honolulu-bound lanes of the highway, where the vehicle was hit, will remain closed until at least Monday, Sakahara said. He said there are several large boulders, some as big as a vehicle, that are still at risk of falling. Crews will need to secure the hillside before clearing debris on the road and reopening the highway.

Pieces of concrete from Old Pali Road, the original route from Honolulu to the windward side of Oahu, also came down with the slide. Officials said in a statement that the road had significant cracks and damage that need to be secured.

In August, a landslide covered the same area of the Honolulu-bound lanes of the highway during the morning rush-hour commute. Falling rocks damaged four vehicles during that landslide, but no one was injured.

Much of California’s Central Coast is under a flash flood watch through Thursday morning. Officials have warned of potential high winds, power outages and debris flows.

The state is notorious for a deadly cycle of fires followed by rain and mudslides. But slides can also occur days, weeks and even months after it stops raining.

Here are some key points from the pages of The Times and other sources. Also check out this infographic on how mudslides happen.

How mudslides happen

In a burned area , a wildfire can make the soils repellent to water, creating a floodlike flow on the ground that picks up rocks and debris.

In an area that has not burned, soil can become saturated. Pressure builds up underground and soil starts moving, picking up mud and debris as it flows downhill.

Water rushing down with only mud is called a mudflow. If the flow picks up rocks, branches and rocks or boulders, that’s called a debris flow. Mud and debris flows are types of shallow landslides , generally defined as less than 15 feet deep.

Another type of shallow landslide involves a saturated hillside that collapses but does not move very far, such as one that buries a roadway with dirt and rocks from a neighboring slope. They can happen up to an hour after a burst of intense rain.

In areas where the bedrock is very deep, rainwater can seep deep underground during multiple rainstorms. During a series of repeated heavy storms, water can accumulate and build up pressure. The pressure can destabilize an entire chunk of land, causing it to collapse downhill. Landslides can happen slowly, and they may show warning signs like cracking or subtle movements, allowing people time to escape. But they can also strike rapidly with no warning, even on a rainless day months after the end of winter.

Tips to stay safe

Here are some basic tips to prepare for mudslides from the California Department of Conservation:"	neg

As state officials announced Thursday, Pali Highway is expected to remain closed for repairs until at least August as crews carry out a two-part plan to make it safer at an estimated cost of $15 million.

On Friday, state Department of Transportation officials took the media on a tour of the three trouble spots where landslides caused damage last month: Old Pali Road, the mudslide area on the Kailua-bound lanes of the highway on the Windward side of the tunnel, and the rockfall site between the two tunnels on the Honolulu-bound side of the highway.

The tour started at the now-shuttered Pali Lookout and Old Pali Road, where the wind sheer was so strong that it was difficult to walk against the force or keep hard hats on.

Once there, the most striking sight was the section of the road that had sloughed off and down the slope. Boulders from higher up had damaged the road, sending pieces of concrete down onto Pali Highway.

PHOTO GALLERY >> Tour of Pali Highway landslide area

Contractors from Prometheus Construction are rappelling down the slope from the road and putting in anchors to eventually install a strong, mesh barrier to catch debris from the slope above.

The second site on the tour was on the Kailua-­bound side of Pali Highway, where a mudslide occurred Feb. 18 on the hillside after the tunnel.

Crews have installed erosion mats on the hillside, hydro-mulched it to encourage grass to grow faster, and will also install mesh to prevent debris from falling, according to DOT spokesman Tim Sakahara.

The third site — the area between the two tunnels on Pali Highway town-bound, where large boulders and dirt came sliding down Feb. 18 — is a key area of focus for the state.

Sakahara said this spot is a concern for future rockfalls due to the topography of the Koolaus, which funnels down toward the tunnel.

On Friday a massive pile of rubble, including rocks, dirt and chunks of concrete from Old Pali Road, completely blocked off the entrance to the secondtunnel.

Crews are working seven days a week to remove it, Sakahara said, and about a dozen truckloads a day are being hauled away. He said removal of the debris from the area is anticipated to be done Sunday.

According to the state’s two-part plan, the crews will first install the mesh barrier on the slope at Old Pali Road to help catch falling debris.

Once that is done, at about the end of April, they will extend the entrance to the second tunnel, Honolulu-­bound, about 80 feet. It will be a new structure designed to deflect falling debris away from the road.

Future landslides are expected, said Sakahara, so the state’s goal is to put protection measures in place.

The distance between the two tunnels on Pali Highway town-bound is about 475 feet.

The Pali Lookout, meanwhile, remains closed. The state also urges the public to avoid trails in the area, including the Likeke Falls hike between the lookout and the Koolau Golf Course.

Access to Pali Highway will remain the same as in previous weeks for the rest of March. Two contra-flow lanes of Honolulu-bound traffic will be open from 5 to 9 a.m. weekdays, and all lanes of Kailua/Kaneohe­-bound traffic will be open from 3 to 7 p.m. weekdays."	pos

While such mudflows, known as lahar, are common in regions with high volcanic activity, experts and activists say the impact in Albay was exacerbated by the loose material left by quarrying operations.

Quarrying of volcanic ash and debris from the slopes of Albay’s Mount Mayon feeds construction projects across the Philippines and is a key economic driver in the province.

But watchdogs say the proliferation of mismanaged quarries is a result of a rarely scrutinized industry that is often under the watch of the local government.

ALBAY, Philippines — When Typhoon Goni made landfall in the Philippines on Nov. 1, 2020, experts predicted disaster.

A day earlier, the national volcanology institute, PHIVOLCS, had warned that heavy rainfall from the storm, known locally as Super Typhoon Rolly, could trigger a flow of lahar: the slurry of mud generated when rainwater mixes with volcanic ash, and which can barrel downslope like a river of concrete.

The prediction proved accurate. After Goni hit, a lahar avalanche coursed down the unstable sides of Mount Mayon, an active volcano, burying 300 houses, killing five people and leaving three missing in the town of Guinobatan in Albay province.

“Despite our preemptive evacuation response, we had casualties because the flood reached parts of the villages that were not flooded before,” Joy Maravillas, Guinobatan’s disaster risk and reduction management head, tells Mongabay.

For many in Albay, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of Manila, the culprit for the disaster was not just the typhoon: villagers say the rampant and poorly regulated quarrying taking place uphill amplified the devastation caused by the typhoon.

In an online interview, former Guinobatan mayor Christopher Flores says that “floods are natural in Guinobatan,” and that “there is nothing intrinsically wrong with quarrying.” But he adds that “the [excessive] quarrying activities definitely exacerbated and made the floods more devastating and catastrophic. [Add] to that … the substandard dikes.”

Guinobatan, thanks to its location on the slope of Mayon, lies in the path of the lahar flows. That makes Guinobatan “a potential catch basin during a torrential downpour,” environmental planner Randy Panesa says in a phone interview.

In 2019, 369 permits were issued to 135 quarrying companies in Albay province, according to records from the Philippine government’s Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB). Seventy of the permits were for quarries within Guinobatan’s borders.

Arnold Embestro, a former member of the provincial legislative council, tells Mongabay that the locals’ complaints about kalot na (“hollowed out”) quarries are reasonable. The proliferation of permits allows operators to quarry beyond their designated areas, he says. There are also the illegal operators to consider.

With the spike in quarrying, it becomes difficult to monitor and regulate each operation, Embestro says. What follows will be “excavations without due consideration for protection of embankments,” he adds.

Ettel Tocare, a resident of the lahar-hit village of San Francisco in Guinobatan, says her home was buried in rocks and debris washed down from the quarry sites. “Lives and livelihoods were lost because of a greedy few,” Tocare says. “Everyone involved should pay.”

Activist groups have also supported demands for an independent probe into the incident. “The flow of lahar in the community of Barangay San Francisco in Guinobatan tells a tale of probable mismanagement or even illegal quarrying activities,” Leon Dulce, national coordinator for Kalikasan PNE, an environmental NGO, said in a press release.

Jonas Leones, undersecretary at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, said in a local interview that “affected residents may sue the companies for compensation for the damage they have caused.”

A disputed link

By Nov. 2, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte had ordered an extensive check of all quarrying operations in Albay province. An initial investigation by the MGB office for the Bicol region, of which Albay is a part, revealed that 15 quarry operators were violating their licenses. Nine had mined beyond their designated coverage areas.

An aerial survey of the lahar-affected areas conducted by the Albay Public Safety and Emergency Management Office found no direct link between quarrying and the lahar flows. The DENR also dismissed any such link, concluding that the scale of the disaster was “largely due to natural processes,” following a survey of the area by a task force.

Residents say they still want the quarry operators to be penalized, including those with expired or with no quarry permits from the local government, along with the local officials they blame for failing to do their duties.

On the DENR’s website, MGB director Wilfredo Moncano said the bureau would endorse the initial findings of its Bicol office to the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) for necessary actions. These include either a suspension of the violators’ environmental compliance certificate (ECC) or rehabilitation of their quarry areas and a fine. But no such punishments have been imposed to date, more than three months after the avalanche, leaving affected residents increasingly frustrated.

In 2018, Ed Laguerta, the resident volcanologist for PHIVOLCS’s Bicol office at the time, warned that unregulated quarry operations could cause the remobilization of lahar flows. He cited the case of Typhoon Durian in 2006, which triggered a mudflow on Mayon’s slopes that killed 1,500 people and buried several villages in Albay, including in Guinobatan.

Laguerta’s warning came a year after the number of quarry operators in the province jumped to more than 100 from only 25 in 2017, and around the same time that PHIVOLCS proposed the provincial government ban quarrying within the 6-km (4-mi) permanent danger zone (PDZ) around Mayon’s crater. The PDZ is defined as the area where life-threatening dangers like rockfalls or sudden eruptions are deemed to be a permanent threat. The provincial government did not take up the proposal.

Paul Alanis, the current PHIVOLCS Bicol resident volcanologist, said he couldn’t recall the proposal, but added that it makes sense since ideally, that should be the case for all economic activities being carried out on the volcano’s slopes.

“If people see any activities in the PDZ, including the quarry workers that sometimes build temporary quarters, locals would think it’s alright to follow suit,” he said in a phone interview.

Alanis added that his institute’s monitoring technology can detect signs of human activity around Mayon’s danger zone. “However, our current program filters anything that has nothing to do with volcanic activity. And our people are not trained to detect such activities because it is outside our mandate,” he said.

‘Hollowed out’

Quarrying is a major driver of the economy in Albay, where the volcanic ash and debris that has piled up from countless eruptions blankets Mayon’s slopes and riverbanks, providing an easy source of high-grade construction material.

In 2018, operators quarried 3.9 million cubic meters (138 million cubic feet) of volcanic material, valued at nearly 551 million pesos ($11.5 million), according to MGB data obtained by Mongabay. That’s almost seven times more material, and 20 times the value, that they produced in 2015.

In addition to the revenue and jobs that quarrying generates, the material itself is a key ingredient in the construction projects that are central to the Bicol Regional Development Plan, especially in tourism and transportation. Projects under Duterte’s “Build, Build, Build” program also benefit from Albay’s volcanic bounty, including the nearly 5 billion peso ($104 million) Bicol International Airport, as well as projects in the Visayas region of the central Philippines.

The industry in Albay has been linked to local politicians; Guinobatan councilor Venerando Padua Jr. obtained four permits in 2019 to quarry on 4 hectares (10 acres) of land in Travesia village, according to records from MGB’s Bicol office.

“Quarry proponents are usually local government or local corporate interests,” Leon Dulce, national coordinator for Kalikasan PNE, an environmental NGO, tells Mongabay in an online interview.

Among the 15 companies reported by the MGB to be in violation of licensing regulations is Sunwest Construction and Development Corporation (SCDC), founded and run by Elizaldy Co, a lawmaker in the Philippine Congress. SCDC holds permits in two separate areas in Albay province: in downtown Legazpi City and in the neighboring town of Daraga.

While officials in Guinobatan have not linked the quarrying activity to the floods, affected residents like Tocare say they want a transparent probe. Dulce says that just because quarrying faces less scrutiny than mining, it doesn’t mean local governments can be complacent about it. The fact that only one of the 106 quarry operators in Albay has a permit from the DENR, with the rest issued by provincial authorities, underscores the big responsibility local officials have to keep a watch on them, together with the DENR and MGB, Dulce says.

The Philippines’ position in the western Pacific’s typhoon corridor and the seismically active Ring of Fire means the threat of rain-triggered lahar is ever-present. And while typhoons and volcanic eruptions can’t be regulated, activities like quarrying, which can exacerbate the impact of lahar, can, activists say.

Environmental planner Panesa, who hails from Guinobatan, says the income from quarrying is hard to resist. But he adds that understanding when and where to dig, and the amount to quarry, can help save lives while providing jobs for locals as deputized wardens can help with monitoring.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - More than 20 people have been killed or are missing due to landslides and floods as monsoon rains lashed Nepal, the government said on Friday.

Heavy rains since Thursday have hit 20 of Nepal’s 77 districts, in the hills as well as in southern plains.

A Home Ministry statement said 15 people had been killed, while six others were missing and 13 were injured as incessant rains caused landslides and triggered flash floods in rivers originating in the Himalayas.

In the capital, Kathmandu, three members of a family were killed when the wall of their house collapsed.

Television channels showed police evacuating residents from flooded homes in rubber boats in some parts of Kathmandu where roads were flooded. Families carrying their belongings on their heads waded through waist-deep water.

“We have evacuated more than 150 people and are on the standby for rescue in different areas,” army spokesman Bigyan Dev Pandey said.

Officials said the Kosi River in eastern Nepal, which flows into the eastern Indian state of Bihar, had risen above the danger mark.

The weather office asked residents to remain alert saying heavy rains were expected to continue through the weekend.

The annual monsoon rains, which normally start in June and continue through September often result in casualties in Nepal, a country of 30 million people."	neg

A man injured in a mudslide on State Route 70 in Hawkins County early Thursday morning has died, Tennessee Highway Patrol reports.

Steven Lawson, 62, of Jonesborough died of injuries sustained after his 1997 Chevrolet pickup truck ran off the road, which had been washed away, and rolled down an embankment, landing on its top.

THP's report said Lawson was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol and was wearing a seat belt.

The mudslide occurred near Cave Springs Road and involved two cars. One person was transported from the scene by Hawkins County Emergency Medical Services.

The area is currently closed to traffic. TDOT has issued detour routes.

From State Road 70 in Rogersville, take State Route 1 (US 11W) South to State Road 31 North in Mooresburg, to State Road 33 North to State Road 70 North.

From State Road 70 in Kyles Ford, take State Road 33 South to State Road 31 South in Sneedville, to State Road 1 (US 11W) North in Mooresburg, to State Road 70 North in Rogersville.

TDOT spokesperson Mark Nagi said the slide is about a mile from the area where a previous mudslide in Hawkins County occurred a couple of years ago. TDOT engineers have been working on preliminary evaluations of the mudslide, which is still unstable.

Emergency responders form the Kingsport Fire Department were also on the scene Thursday morning to help assist in rescuing the people involved in the landslide.

Tonight, another atmospheric river will descend on Portland, bringing heavy rains and flood warnings.

Though we're due for another dumping tonight, Portland saw the worst of the rain last night. The Gorge and the Cascade foothills, however, could see their highest levels of precipitation yet this winter.

Rainstorms aren't exactly unusual winter weather in Oregon, but this particular system will fall heaviest on areas that were recently damaged by fire. That means that landslides are a nail-biting possibility.

""We're pretty concerned about the threat for debris flows and slides,"" says Andy Bryant, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. ""All of the burnt areas in the Cascade foothills are going to be affected, it's just a matter of, will the rain be heavy enough to cause problems?""

The Cascade foothills—including areas damaged by the Beachie Creek and Riverside fires—have already been subjected to substantial rainfall that hasn't led to widespread problems. But tonight's rain could be heavier than any of the other storms that have passed through the region this winter.

In impact reports released last month, the Natural and Cultural Resources Recovery Task Force declared several areas along Highway 22 ""very high risk"" for debris flow due to fire damage. The recently reopened Eagle Creek area will also see heavy precipitation and possible erosion damage.

Closer to Portland, Johnson Creek, the Sandy River and the Clackamas River all have flood warnings.

The risk for power outages, however, is low. Winds aren't expected to become strong enough to topple trees and cause downed lines.

""The one caveat to that is, with the ground so saturated, if there's a tree that's on the weak side, it might blow over,"" says Bryant. ""But I think those types of incidents will be isolated.""

The heaviest rain is forecast to fall overnight and let up tomorrow morning. For the rest of the week, Portlanders will only have to deal with much gentler rainfall."	neg

Every major route between the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, where Canada’s third largest city of Vancouver is, and the interior of the province has been cut by washouts, flooding or landslides following record-breaking rain across southern British Columbia between Saturday and Monday. The body of a woman was recovered from one of the mudslides late Monday.

“Torrential rains have led to terrible flooding that has disrupted the lives and taken lives of people across B.C. I want people to know that the federal government has been engaging with the local authorities,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in Washington. “We’re sending resources like the Canadian Armed Forces to support people but also we’ll be there for the cleanup and the rebuilding after impacts of these extreme weather events.”

The federal government said it was sending the air force to assist with evacuations and to support supply lines.

Military helicopters already helped evacuate about 300 people from one highway where people were trapped in their cars Sunday night following a mudslide.

“We expect to confirm even more fatalities in the coming days,” British Columbia Premier John Horgan said.

Horgan called it a once in a 500 years event. He said the state of emergency will include travel restrictions so the transport of essential goods medical and emergency services will reach the communities that need them. He asked people not to hoard goods.

“These are very challenging times. I’ve been at this dais for two years now talking about challenging times we have faced — unprecedented challenges with public health, wildfires, heat domes and now debilitating floods that we have never seen before,” Horgan said.

Horgan said over the past six months there have been drought conditions in Merritt, where the river was at its lowest point in living memory and where people had to be evacuated because of wildfires in temperatures that were unprecedented. And now, he said, much of the community is under water.

“We need to start preparing for a future that includes more events like this,” Horgan said.

The weather events are all connected and can be attributed to climate change, said John Clague, a professor in the Earth Sciences Department at Simon Fraser University.

“Scientists are now saying these particular events, they’re becoming more frequent, exacerbated or ramped up by climate change,” he said.

The record temperatures in the summer set the stage for the wildfires, said Clague. The fires burned the ground in a way that prevents water from seeping into the soil. He said that resulted in the water from the torrential rains pouring more quickly into steams and rivers, causing floods.

The total number of people and vehicles unaccounted for had not yet been confirmed near the town of Lillooet. Investigators had received reports of two other people who were missing but added that other motorists might have been buried in a slide on Highway 99. ”

Chelsey Hughes said she was thankful to have survived the slide that slammed into her car before it landed in a swamp as she was driving along the highway. Hughes was heading home Sunday when she saw a tree starting to fall as a slide shoved her car about a mile off the road and down an embankment.

“Then the car stopped moving and I was just shocked. I was afraid to move because I didn’t know if I was injured,” she said after spending about five hours shivering on top of her car without a jacket next to another vehicle with four university students sharing one jacket atop their vehicle.

When Hughes finally connected with a 911 dispatcher, he helped her monitor one student’s condition after he had an asthma attack before they finally saw the lights of rescuers.

They spent an hour hiking out, she said of the traumatic events that unfolded Sunday night before nine of them were taken to hospital. She said she has been thinking about the family of a woman who died.

“I think that could have been any one of us, and there’s nothing that you can do. When we got hit by that landslide, we just had to surrender,” she said.

Agriculture Minister Lana Popham said thousands of animals had died and the province was rushing to get veterinarians to other animals that are in danger.

“I can also tell you that many farmers attempted to move animals and then had to walk away because the roads were disappearing beneath them,” she said.

A trade expert said the loss of major transportation routes will hurt the movement of goods both in and out Canada’s largest port in Vancouver.

“Vancouver really has an outsized role to play in our Pacific trade,” said Werner Antweiler, an associate professor at the UBC Sauder School of Business. “Commodities will be impacted in a much more significant way because it’s coming by rail or coming by big trucks.”

Heavy rain caused the landslide in Thaphyu Kone village, in the southern Mon state, sending mud crashing into a cluster of houses and burying residents.

“The rescue team found 22 bodies yesterday and seven more this morning,” Tin Maung Ni, the director of Mon state’s fire department, told Reuters, adding that 28 survivors had been freed.

As he spoke, three more bodies were pulled from the mud.

Severe rainfall has pummeled southern Myanmar for days, causing flooding that has displaced at least 12,000 people, according to the United Nations.

Standing beside the ruins of her house, 35-year-old Nyo Nyo Win said, “This was my home. Now, everything is gone. We have nothing left.”

Nine members of her family were killed, including her son and father, she said.

First, lamp posts on the road started to fall off and then villagers ran toward their homes for fear of being electrocuted, she said.

“All the people who made it to their homes were buried, including my father and eight children who were at home. It happened so fast, just in seconds.”

Survivors were sent to a hospital in the nearest major town, Mawlamyine.

“First, I heard a ‘boom’ sound and I was under the mud,” said 35-year-old Phyo Ko Ko Oo.

His left leg was badly scraped as he struggled to free himself.

Chan Aye, 42, said he, his son and wife had been dragged to the river by the landslide.

“I hugged them as we were dragged along with the landslide,” he said.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement that houses and a school have been washed away in other townships affected by the flooding.

Gov. Josh Green, acting on behalf of Gov. David Ige who is in Washington, D.C., issued an emergency proclamation today designating the location of the Pali Highway landslides a disaster area and providing relief for related damage and losses.

The proclamation authorizes the use of state funds to address extensive damage to the slopes along the highway and gives the governor the power to expedite emergency management functions, according to the governor’s office. The proclamation is effective immediately and extends through April 22.

Ige is attending the National Governors Association Winter Meeting in Washington.

The Pali trouble started Monday with landslides near and onto the highway after days of rain.

The landslides closed the highway, a major Windward-downtown artery, until the state Department of Transportation reopened the roadway to one-way, town-bound traffic from 5 to 9 a.m., starting on Thursday. The morning rush-hour, town-bound traffic on weekdays is being contraflowed onto the Kailua-bound lanes.

The highway is also opened for Windward-bound traffic only weekdays from 3 to 7 p.m. for the evening commute.

Transportation officials expect the shutdown to last months as state crews fortify the unstable slopes near the Pali tunnels. The highway will also be closed over the next two weekends as work continues. Next week, it will reopen for the contraflowing of the morning and evening commutes for weekdays.

Hikers are asked to stay away from the Likeke Falls hike below Pali Highway until further notice.

State crews are working to dislodge loose material from the slope. Officials said some material is falling downslope of the highway toward the Koolau Golf Course, posing a rockfall danger to those on the trail below.

The Pali Lookout also remains closed.

Transportation officials said they expect to issue an update on proposed slope stabilization designs and a revised schedule for access using the Windward-bound lanes during the week of March 4.

Instead, the youthful 43-year-old returned to his job a three-hour journey away as a backhoe operator for a jade mining company, keen to earn money to support a growing family, four relatives told Reuters.

Brang Aung had worked in Hpakant, northern Myanmar’s notoriously dangerous mining district, for eight years, but still told his family - Christians from the Kachin ethnic minority - to pray for his safety.

During a night shift on April 22, disaster struck. A muddy lake above his employer’s mining site breached its banks, unleashing a wave of water and dirt that buried 55 men instantly. None survived.

The tragedy was a reminder of the dangers workers such as Brang Aung face daily unearthing the valuable gemstone that is prized in neighboring China.

“The companies are earning a lot, but they don’t value the lives of the people at all,” said Brang Aung’s mother, Hkawn Bu. “It’s not just one or two people who have died, it’s hundreds. The government should protect its own citizens.”

The family never held a naming ceremony, but call the boy Htoi San Aung, the name Brang Aung had chosen for his son.

Jobs in the hills of Hpakant can pay well by the standards of rural Myanmar - Brang Aung earned around $290 a month. But the area has a reputation for lawlessness, with high rates of drug addiction and HIV, and the jade mines themselves are frequently hit by deadly accidents.

The government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi pledged to clean up the industry when it took power in 2016, but activists say little has changed.

Reliable statistics on safety in Hpakant were not available, but media have reported scores killed in the past three years, many of them freelance “jade pickers” who scour tailings - the residue from mining - for stones that have been missed by larger operators.

Myo Nyunt, a spokesman for Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) party, said the jade industry was beset by “many difficulties because regulations are not being followed”.

Regulations were still being drafted to implement a new law passed last year that would help bring mining under control by limiting the area covered by individual licenses, he said, reducing the power of large companies.

“The more we can control the influence of big companies, the more effectively we can work on workers’ safety,” Myo Nyunt said.

‘UNLAWFUL SITUATION’

Undated photos of the site taken before the incident in which Brang Aung was killed, posted on Facebook, show a large pool of water had formed above where his employer, Myanmar-owned Nine Golden Dragons, was digging for jade.

The company and a neighboring block’s occupant, Myanmar Thura, had scraped away the earth until a cliff towered above them on one side, with the muddy lake on the other.

Reuters was unable to reach either of the companies for comment. Office addresses for both listed on a government companies’ registry were out of date. Workers present at the mine site when Reuters visited declined to comment.

Suu Kyi’s NLD won a landslide victory in a historic election in November 2015, the same month that a massive slag heap collapsed in Hpakant and killed more than 100 people. A spokesman for the party told Reuters at the time the new administration would review regulations to ensure the mining area was safe.

Months after taking power, the NLD government announced a moratorium on new licenses, drawing praise from activists.

But companies whose licenses expire often simply move their machinery to a mining block licensed to another company and enter an informal revenue-sharing arrangement, monitors say.

Aung Nyunt Thein, managing director of the Myanmar Gems Enterprise, a state-owned enterprise that is the main regulator of the jade industry, said firms were allowed to agree to “share” their business in this way.

A group of community organizations wrote to President Win Myint in September last year, warning of the dangers of an “unlawful situation” in Hpakant.

The letter raised concerns about environmental damage from mining, the overuse of dynamite, and violent crime and drug abuse going unchecked in the area.

“Many people have also been killed by landfill collapses because of dumping earth without discipline,” the letter said.

Reuters was unable to reach officials at the president’s office for comment.

Aung Nyunt Thein said Myanmar Gems Enterprise does regulate mining in the area, for example by restricting companies’ use of dynamite. But he added: “Hpakant is not normal. The rule of law is weak there.”

Another official at the regulator, deputy managing director Thet Khaing, said officials “don’t have the resources to manage the quantity of permissions we have given”.

“JUST DOING THEIR WORK”

Five days after the April 22 collapse, the scene was unrecognizable from the earlier photographs.

Kyaw Kyaw Lwin, one of about a dozen rescue workers still on the site, told visiting Reuters reporters that there was no hope of pulling bodies from the deep pit of thick mud that had entombed the workers and their machines.

“It’s impossible to find a body in this mud. If a body floats up, we try our best to retrieve it,” he said.

Some machinery was recovered from the mud, but just five bodies were retrieved. Brang Aung’s was not among them.

“The thing I want most is for them to find the body of my son,” said Hkawn Bu, shedding a tear. “Whatever the body looks like, whether it’s black and blue, I want to see it.”

Following the collapse, authorities suspended 17 mining blocks belonging to 11 companies around Hpakant, citing safety concerns. Nine Golden Dragons and Myanmar Thura, named by authorities as the two companies whose workers died on April 22, were not included and have faced no censure.

According to data submitted by Myanmar as part of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), Nine Golden Dragons holds three active licenses in Maw Wan Lay, the area of the collapse, as well as eight other active licenses.

Myanmar Thura has held three licenses in different areas nearby, but all had expired by the end of 2017, the data shows.

Myanmar Gems Enterprise investigated the incident and found the companies were not at fault, said Aung Myint Thein.

“According to our investigation they didn’t break the rules. They were just doing their work and the instability of the earth happened,” he said.

Brang Aung’s family accepted compensation of about $30,000 from his employer. It was more than most have received in past payouts for industrial accidents in Hpakant, according to activists.

The total compensation paid to families of the April 22 disaster’s victims would be equivalent to just “one good piece of jade”, Hkawn Bu told Reuters. Jade brokers say a high quality jade stone can be worth in excess of $1 million.

Official sales of jade in Myanmar were worth 671 million euros ($750.04 million) in 2016-17, the most recent year for which government data has been published under EITI.

But experts believe the true value of the industry, which mainly exports to China, is much larger.

The New York-based Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI) estimates that between 59% and 74% of jade by volume is not registered with authorities and therefore out of sight of tax authorities, based on data from 2014 to 2016.

Regulators remain underfunded and unable to inspect the hundreds of mining operations, said Maw Htun Aung, NRGI’s Myanmar country manager.

“Nobody follows the safety procedure,” he said of the state of the industry in Hpakant. “Lives are really cheap.”"	pos

The highway remains closed in both directions as the Hawaii Department of Transportation inspects the slopes near the tunnels.

Athena Zamora was heading to Kailua with her two daughters.

She said they passed the tunnels and made it through just before most of the mud and large rocks started coming down on the right lane.

Some dirt and debris struck her car, but she had to keep driving until she reached a runaway truck ramp to pull over and call police.

Zamora was relieved that there was only a small dent on her vehicle.

“It was a pretty scary event, something that I probably won’t soon forget. The sound, it was pretty significant,"" she said. “My daughters were pretty shaken up. We’re fine. We’re thankful and grateful with the outcome.”

Authorities closed the right lane and later shut down all Kailua-bound lanes of the highway at Waokanaka Street.

A larger landslide came down near the tunnels in the opposite direction at about 4:15 p.m.

The debris struck a truck driven by Kaneohe resident Yoster Loney.

Two of his five children who were riding with him in the cab suffered minor injuries.

His girlfriend, who was sitting in the bed of the truck, was seriously hurt.

“(There was) mud on the windshield and on the backside mud, too, rocks and small kind of wood,” said Loney.

The three victims were released from the Queen’s Medical Center late Monday night.

91	256	https://www.sierrawave.net/5-8-earthquake-south-of-lone-pine-near-olancha/	5.8 Earthquake south of Lone Pine near Olancha! (Wed. June 24) - Sierra Wave: Eastern Sierra News	2020-06-24 11:19:16-07:00	"There was definitely some ground movement this morning at 10:40 a.m. It has been reported that a magnitude 5.8 earthquake occurred 12 miles south of the town of Lone Pine, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Social media immediately took note of the earthquake, which was felt as far away as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Central Valley and Southern California. Lone Pine, Independence, Big Pine and Bishop have not reported any serious damage to structures or injuries.

A quick call to the Inyo County Public Information Officer, Carma Roper, at the Inyo County Sheriff’s Office, found that no damage had as yet been reported other than a possible rock slide in the area, which they were on there way to investigate. Later it was reported that there might be injuries as a result of the rock slide, but that has not yet been confirmed. Lone Pine Fire Department has responded along with the Sheriff’s Department.

[Sheriff Update 2:14 pm: Whitney Portal area is closed and campgrounds are being evacuated due to rock slide south of the main parking lot. No injuries reported at this time. It is unclear at this time if the main Mt Whitney trail has been affected. It is believed that this slide was triggered by the recent 5.8 earthquake near the Lone Pine area.



Onion Valley Road: open, no reported damage; Horseshoe Meadows Road: closed, debris/rocks in the road; Glacier Lodge Road: open, no reported damage

We are assessing a reported rockslide on Whitney Portal Road and reported debris on Horseshoe Meadows Road. No additional information is known at this time. All updates will be posted.]

Kathleen New, the Chamber of Commerce Executive Director in Lone Pine, reported that they exited the office as soon as the ground started moving and that, “I was really surprised at how long it lasted.” She had no reports of damage other than next door at Gardner’s Hardware, which she said “Was a bit of a mess.” She was going to go over to help the owners “clean up.”

Sierra Wave’s Kat Greenman was in Lone Pine in front of Lee’s Frontier Liquor & Deli & Gas when the earthquake hit. She said it scared the **** out of her! She had never been outside during one and she said that it almost caused her to lose her balance, something that’s never before happened.

Kathy Chambers, the librarian at the Lone Pine Library, told Sierra Wave that she was at home when the earthquake struck, but went immediately to the library (which was closed due to the coronavirus pandemic) to assess the damage. She said there’s plenty of books on the floor and that in one aisle in particular, she couldn’t even walk down it.

Lone Pine is no stranger to earthquakes. Just days prior to today’s shaker, the area has experienced several small earthquakes which are reportedly taken place under the Owens Dry Lake Bed.

In 1872 on March 26, the Owens Valley earthquake (a.k.a., Lone Pine earthquake) killed twenty-seven people and injured fifty-six. It had a magnitude 7.4 to 7.9 and was one of the largest earthquakes to hit California in recorded history, similar in size to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

Sierra Wave will keep you posted as more information comes in."	neg

A landslide in the Himalayas in Northern India has killed at least two dozen people and more than 150 are missing.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

A massive search-and-rescue operation is underway in Northern India. On Sunday, a landslide barreled down out of the Himalayan mountains. At least two dozen people have been killed. More than 150 are missing. NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from Mumbai.

LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: One local resident said it happened so fast there was no time to alert anyone.

(SOUNDBITE OF LANDSLIDE)

FRAYER: Video shows a torrent of rocks, water and debris surging down a ravine below the Nanda Devi glacier. A hydroelectric dam snaps in half and washes away. Many of those missing are construction workers trapped in a tunnel underground.

(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY RUNNING)

FRAYER: Soldiers and police are spending a second night trying to dig them out. This man was one of the lucky ones pulled out alive.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).

FRAYER: ""We'd lost all hope. We thought we would die,"" he says, describing how he clung to the tunnel's roof as water gushed in. This is an area of India's Uttarakhand state, where mighty rivers pour down from the Himalayas. But environmental experts have long warned against building dams and power plants there because it's ecologically fragile and so prone to floods and landslides. In 2013, about 6,000 people died in flooding there.

DAN SHUGAR: We're starting to see, you know, some of the impacts of climate change - increased numbers of landslides, really large landslides in the high mountains.

FRAYER: Geoscientist Dan Shugar is on the other side of the world at the University of Calgary poring over satellite images of this disaster.

SHUGAR: What's a little odd about this one is, you know, it happened in February when, you know, the ground ought to be frozen.

FRAYER: Indian authorities have described this as a glacial break, part of the Nanda Devi glacier cleaving off. But Shugar says it looks to him more like a landslide. He says it'll take weeks or months to investigate.

(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

FRAYER: Meanwhile, the Indian military is airlifting in more equipment. The people trapped underground may have only hours.

The mine in the Tibesti region near the Libyan border collapsed early on Tuesday and more victims might still be buried in the rubble, defense minister Mahamat Sala told Reuters.

Tibesti has witnessed rapid growth in illegal mining in recent years, often by refugees from Sudan looking for quick money to head to Europe or by rebels fighting the army.

Unsafe methods and a lack of oversight mean accidents are common at such mines in Africa, where impoverished communities seek a share of the vast resources that are usually dug up by international companies, processed and sent overseas.

Last June, more than 40 people died when part of a Glencore copper and cobalt mine collapsed in southeast Congo."	pos

A spokesman for Anih Bhd said that a tow truck service will be used today to remove vehicles stranded at the location.

According to her, the all-day operation that started at around 7am was conducted only after the location could be accessed by the concession company’s staff.

She said all personnel had been stationed at several locations on the highway to render relevant assistance, such as distributing food and beverages to the victims.

As at 10pm last night, the Km76 to Km126 stretch of the Karak-Temerloh route was still closed in both directions.

Meanwhile, Pengurusan Air Pahang Bhd (Paip) chief executive officer Saiful Zaini Mohd Bokhari said a total of 13 water treatment plants (LRAs) involving the districts of Kuantan, Temerloh, Bentong, Lipis and Raub are not operational due to flooding.

He said following the shutdown of the LRAs, a total of 53,916 user accounts experienced water supply disruptions.

“The closure started yesterday with four LRAs, but increased to 13 LRAs due to rising river water levels as well as power outages from Tenaga Nasional Bhd.

“Assistance in the form of clean water supply and static tanks has been mobilised to the affected relief centres, but there are still many areas that are flooded, causing difficulty in delivering treated water via tankers,” he said in a statement last night. – Bernama, December 20, 2021"	pos

The highway will remain closed on weekends, with the exception of Saturday night, when the H-3 freeway is scheduled for tunnel road maintenance.

The Kailua-bound direction of the Pali will be open from 7 p.m. Saturday through 7 a.m. Sunday while the H-3, Kaneohe bound, will be closed between the Halawa and Halekou interchanges.

The state Department of Transportation plans to provide another update next week, including the possibility of extended access hours.

In the meantime, officials ask motorists to drive with caution through the Pali tunnels, which have no lights after the rockslide damaged electrical conduits.

Electronic message signs about the tunnel lights are posted at the Pali lookout going Honolulu bound, and at the runaway truck ramp on the Windward side.

Crews have replaced reflectors and striped edge lines within the tunnels to improve visibility on Pali Highway, and plan to install additional reflectors on the road to the hairpin turn, transportation officials said Power is expected to be restored to the Pali tunnels by March 8.

Authorities fear flooding and mudslides in the days ahead after heavy rain lashed the region.

Nearly 700,000 people could be at risk, with many left exposed and hungry as waters rise.

Mozambique's disaster management agency said one person had died in Pemba city and another in hard-hit Macomia district, while residents on Ibo island said two people died there.

Details on the fifth death were not immediately available.

Nearly 3,500 homes in parts of the country's northernmost Cabo Delgado province were partially or fully destroyed, with electricity cut, some roads blocked and at least one key bridge collapsed.

Some schools and health centres were damaged.

""There's a very intense strip of destruction where the wind first made impact in coastal districts,"" Nicholas Finney, response team leader with the aid group Save the Children, told The Associated Press after visiting Macomia district.

The team found people in shock in a region where a cyclone had never been recorded in the modern age.

Terrified children and traumatised parents ""face a huge task to start to rebuild"", he said.

Rain is forecast over the next several days and Mozambique's meteorological authority said the storm could potentially move back out to sea and intensify again, Mr Finney added.

""It doesn't look good, quite honestly,"" he said of the risk of flooding.

As water levels rose, Mozambique authorities asked residents of Mecufi and Chiure districts and parts of Macomia and Muidumbe districts to immediately seek higher ground.

Some rivers in the region have burst their banks in the past, notably in 2000.

Cyclone Kenneth arrived late on Thursday, just six weeks after Cyclone Idai ripped into central Mozambique and killed more than 600 people.

This was the first time in recorded history that the southern African nation has been hit by two cyclones in one season, again raising concerns about climate change.

The remnants of Kenneth, which packed the power of a Category 4 hurricane, could dump twice as much rain as Idai did last month, the UN World Program has said.

Some forecasts warned of as much as nine inches of torrential rain, or about a quarter of the average annual rainfall for the region.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reported heavy damage to Cabo Delgado province, with the communities of Macomia, Quissanga and Mocimboa da Praia of highest concern.

Communications remained challenging in some areas as authorities and aid groups scrambled to assess the damage, especially in more far-flung communities in the largely rural region.

""The situation wasn't worse thanks to awareness-raising work by local authorities,"" Mozambique's disaster management agency said.

People left homeless tried to patch together shelters from the rain.

""I'm looking for someone to lend me a porch so I can clean it up and stay with my family,"" one Macomia resident, Wild Eusebio, told the Portuguese news agency Lusa.

Typhoon Hagibis, the largest to hit Japan in 61 years, made landfall Saturday evening, sweeping northeast through the Tokyo region as a 5.7 magnitude earthquake struck an area in the storm's path earlier that day.

According to NHK, Japan's national broadcaster, the storm's path has left two dead, 10 missing and 90 injured so far, the 19th named storm this year. At least eight rivers have flooded their banks, several dams have begun discharging water and landslides threaten those sheltering in their homes as Hagibis continues to pour down a record amount of rain and whip the land with strong winds. If the dams do release their water in an emergency measure, they risk flooding downstream areas that already face storm surges, where civilians may not have evacuated.

As NPR reported on Friday, the Japan Meteorological Agency forecast chief Yasushi Kajihara said that Hagibis resembled the 1958 Kanogawa Typhoon that killed more than 1,200. Although the typhoon abated after landfall and has made its way back to the Pacific Ocean without numbers approaching those of the Kanogawa Typhoon, the death toll may rise as recovery and rescues continue for those threatened by continued flooding and landslides.

Officials in Gunma Prefecture said a landslide destroyed houses in Tomioka Saturday evening. Two persons were rescued from the wreckage, but one died afterward. Another two are missing in a Fukushima landslide, according to the Japan Times.

Evacuation orders are still in place for more than 4 million people, although the JMA has lifted emergency warnings on Nagano, Niigata and Fukushima prefectures. Miyagi and Iwate prefectures are still under emergency warnings and are at extreme risk of landslides, and most of central and eastern Japan are under general warnings.

The typhoon made landfall in Shizuoka prefecture Saturday evening local time as the 5.7-magnitude earthquake off the coast of neighboring Chiba province sent tremors ahead of the storm's fury. No tsunami warning was issued after the earthquake. Just north of Shizuoka is Tokyo prefecture, where NHK reports that the Tokyo and Nagano governments have asked Japan's military to assist in the region.

The storm, as of midnight local time, had passed through the Tokai, Tokyo and Kanto regions and is projected to move along the northeastern coast past Hokkaido and the Kuril Islands, according to the JMA. The storm has also left more than 430,000 homes in the Tokyo metropolitan region without power, according to NHK.

Transportation has been disrupted over the weekend, with the Japan Times reporting that rail and airport service has been cancelled in the affected areas until deemed safe. NPR reported that All Nippon Airways grounded all domestic flights coming out of the Tokyo region on Saturday, and the Japan Times reported that Central Japan Railway Co. canceled all shinkansen, or bullet train, service on Saturday.

The storm has also forced the cancellation of Rugby World Cup games as the event approaches the quarterfinals. Two games have already been cancelled, and the Scottish Rugby Union has threatened legal action if its game with Japan is cancelled, not rescheduled, which would advance the Japanese team and send the Scots home.

Typhoon Faxai ripped through Tokyo about a month ago, killing three and injuring 147 after it made landfall in Chiba prefecture. The Japan Times reported that the Abe administration was heavily criticized in the aftermath of that storm for not holding a meeting of ministers before or after landfall as power outages continued in Chiba prefecture well after the storm had passed.

As Hagibis approached the Japanese mainland, Abe's cabinet held a disaster management meeting Friday in order to act more ""proactively"" than with Faxai."	pos

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) on Wednesday, Jan. 19, warned of possible flash floods or landslides in some parts of Bicol and Eastern Visayas due to rains from the shear line–a region where warm and cold winds converge.

“In the next 24 hours, the shear line will bring light to moderate with at times heavy rains over Northern Samar, the northern portion of Eastern Samar, Sorsogon, Albay, and Catanduanes,” PAGASA warned.

“Under these conditions, scattered flooding and rain-induced landslides are likely, especially in areas that are highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards as identified in hazard maps and in areas with significant antecedent rainfall,” it added.

Moreover, PAGASA advised the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned to take appropriate actions.

“PAGASA Regional Services Division may issue local heavy rainfall warnings, rainfall/thunderstorm advisories, and other severe weather information specific to their areas of responsibility as appropriate,” it said.

Meanwhile, the northeast monsoon or “amihan” is expected to continue to bring cold weather and some rains over Metro Manila and the rest of Luzon and Visayas.

In Mindanao, partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers may prevail due to localized thunderstorms."	pos

The shear line or tail-end of frontal system will prevail over Palawan and Visayas, while the northeast monsoon or “amihan” will affect the rest of Luzon in the next couple of hours, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said Wednesday, Nov. 10.

Cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms may prevail over Palawan and Visayas due to the shear line, and over Caraga and Davao Region due to the warm easterly winds.

Cagayan Valley may also experience cloudy skies with rains due to the northeast monsoon.

PAGASA advised those in these areas to stay vigilant against possible flash floods or landslides due to the occurrence of moderate to at times heavy rains.

Meanwhile, Metro Manila and the rest of Luzon will continue to experience partly cloudy to cloudy conditions with isolated light monsoon rains.

The rest of Mindanao will also have generally fair weather conditions apart from isolated rain showers or thunderstorms.

PAGASA said severe thunderstorm activities may sometimes trigger flash floods or landslides.

Weather specialist Benison Estareja said PAGASA has not monitored a tropical cyclone that may develop or affect the country until the weekend.

However, he pointed out that there is a possibility that two or three tropical cyclones may enter the country’s area of responsibility before the end of the month."	pos

SEATTLE — After two homes recently slid off their foundation, one taking a direct hit from a landslide in Seattle’s Magnolia neighborhood, some residents may be wondering if their home is at risk.

While there’s no telling if a slide will happen, when it will happen or how severe it will be, there are some tools and tips that can tell residents whether or not there’s a chance they could be impacted.

The Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) developed a map through the Geologic Information Portal that gives residents an idea of which areas around the state could be susceptible to landslides. Click here to look at the map.

While Pierce County and areas of southwest Washington are the only parts of the region rated for landslide susceptibility, areas typically at the highest risk for landslides are ones that have seen slides in the past.

Looking at the DNR’s map, residents can see even urban areas have experienced landslides in the past, including parts of West Seattle above Alki Beach, areas of Seattle’s Beacon Hill that run along Interstate 5 and parts of Bellevue between Wilburton and Norwood Village, putting them at increased risk.

To the south, Tacoma has many areas that are considered highly susceptible to either deep or shallow slides, including parts of Northeast Tacoma along the Hylebos Waterway and near downtown Tacoma along Commencement Bay.

There are typically hundreds, sometimes thousands, of landslides across Washington state every year, and many of them are not in areas that have experienced slides in the past.

Although it is all but impossible to predict a landslide, there are some warning signs to look out for, including saturated ground, cracks or bulges in the ground and sunken roadbeds.

The U.S. Geological Survey said that the safest areas from landslides are hard, non-jointed bedrock and relatively flat areas.

Homes and structures near sudden slope changes or at the top of ridges can be at an especially high risk of slides.

There are actions people living in landslide-prone areas can take during a slide that could help save their life. Here’s what to do if you’re caught in a landslide:"	pos

Landslides and flooding triggered by heavy monsoon rain hit parts of western India, killing more than 100 people, officials and news reports said Friday. More than 1,000 people trapped by floodwaters were rescued.

The dead included 54 killed in four landslides in the Raigad and Ratnagiri districts in western Maharashtra state on Thursday and Friday, according to District Collector Nidhi Chaudhary and state government official Sagar Pathak.

Many of those who were rescued were stranded on rooftops and even on top of buses on highways, Chaudhary said.

Pathak said more than 30 people were missing after the landslides.

Chaudhary said the rain had slowed, but water levels were rising again because of a high tide Friday. Rescuers, however, have reached the worst-hit areas.

Disasters caused by landslides and flooding are common in India during the June-September monsoon season, when heavy rains weaken the foundations of structures that are often poorly built.

Twenty-seven people were killed by houses collapsing or being swept away by rushing floodwaters in Satara district, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. It also said more than 20 deaths have been reported from the eastern districts of Gondia and Chandrapur.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was anguished by the loss of lives.

“The situation in Maharashtra due to heavy rains is being closely monitored and assistance is being provided to the affected,” Modi tweeted.

Elsewhere, a house collapsed Friday after heavy rains in the Shivaji Nagar area in eastern Mumbai, killing at least four two people and injuring eight others, fire officials said.

In Ratnagiri district, 200 people were rescued from hilly areas on Thursday after the heavy rains. In the coastal town of Chiplun, home to 70,000 people, more than half the area was flooded, said B.N. Patil, district administrator of Ratnagiri.

The army, navy, coast guard and the National Disaster Response Force were helping in rescue operations, the defense ministry said.

An Indian navy statement said it deployed helicopters to evacuate stranded people and sent rescue teams with boats to the region.

Authorities on Friday sounded an alert in the southern state of Telangana, with heavy rains causing flooding in Hyderabad, the state capital, and other low-lying areas.

Meteorologists said the 30 centimeters (12 inches) of rain that has fallen so far this month in Hyderabad, one of India's information technology hubs, is the most in July in 10 years. The floodgates of one of the main reservoirs, Osman Sagar, were opened for the first time in a decade to discharge excess water.

Last weekend, more than 30 people were killed in landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rain in and around Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital.

The monsoon is crucial for rain-fed crops planted during the season, but the rain often causes extensive damage and kills scores of people each year.

Experts said heavy rainfall along India's western coast is in line with how rainfall patterns have changed in the region in past years due to climate change.

“The frequency and intensity of heavy rains has increased,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in the western city of Pune.

He added that the warming Arabian Sea is driving more cyclones and more intense rainfall over short periods of time.

“Every year we need to be prepared on the west coast,” he said.
