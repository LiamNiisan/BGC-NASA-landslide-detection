Guwahati:

Fresh landslides were reported from various parts of Guwahati on Wednesday, amid incessant rainfall, which also led to heavy flooding in most parts of the city, officials said.

During the day there were no reports of new casualties.

The state has recorded 42 deaths this year from flooding and landslides, including four that were buried under a massive mound of earth in the Boragaon area on Tuesday.

An official of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) told PTI that accumulation of debris caused by landslides has blocked passageways in the Geetanagar, Sonapur, Kalapahar and Nijarapar areas.

Heavy rainfall has also flooded roads in several parts of the city – the worst affected among them are Anil Nagar, Nabin Nagar, Rajgarh Link Road, Rukminigaon, Hatigaon and Krishna Nagar.

NDRF and SDRF personnel, deployed in these areas, are using boats to rescue people and offer relief supplies to those still trapped in flooded homes, the official said.

Assam Power Distribution Company Limited (APDCL) is working around the clock to restore power in the city, which has been in darkness since Tuesday, while drinking water tankers have been sent to the flooded areas.

The Kamrup Metropolitan district administration has urged people to leave their homes only if they have urgent or essential work.

Kamrup Metropolitan Deputy Commissioner Pallav Gopal Jha has issued an order ordering all schools, colleges and educational institutions to suspend classes in the wake of a rain alert issued by the Regional Meteorological Center (RMC).

The RMC issued a ‘red alert’ for Assam and Meghalaya and forecast isolated and scattered ‘extremely heavy rain’ from Tuesday to Thursday, and ‘orange alert’ for Friday and Saturday.

A bulletin issued by the ASDMA said the flooding situation in several parts of the state is grim, with eight districts being inundated by rising waters in the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries.

Dima Hasao Deputy Commissioner Nazreen Ahmed has issued an advisory asking people to restrict movement in public places.

The consultancy has urged people in vulnerable locations to go to the nearest notified shelters.

Nazreen Ahmed has issued another order ordering all educational institutions to remain closed until May 17, an official release said.

The mighty Brahmaputra flows above the danger sign at Nimaathat in Jorhat district.

Meanwhile, state congress president Bhupen Boarh led a rally of party members here to protest the state government’s alleged apathy over the situation caused by flash floods in the ‘smart city’.

The protesters, who wade through knee-deep water, were stopped by police from continuing at a distance from the state party headquarters.

Five people died in southeastern China, according to state media reports: A house collapse took three lives in Fujian province on Tuesday, and two died Monday in a landslide caused by torrential rain in neighboring Jiangxi province.

One person died and three are missing in northern China after a vehicle fell into the water in mountain flooding from heavy rain in the Inner Mongolia region.

China regularly experiences seasonal rains and flooding during the summer, most frequently in central and southern areas.

Video on state broadcaster CCTV showed large parts of cities flooded in muddy waters. Rescue workers carried trapped people out of buildings on their backs in waist-deep water in Guangdong province, also in the southeast.

The rain ended Wednesday in Jiangxi, but more precipitation is forecast for another week in Fujian, Jiangxi and Guangdong and the nearby Guangxi region. The National Meteorological Center said residents should prepare for floods and landslides as the soil is already saturated in those areas.

More than 110,000 people have been relocated in Jiangxi province, along with more than 80,000 in Fujian, state media reports said.

Seventeen people died last week in rain-related disasters in Guangxi and in Hunan province in central China.

The scene that had confronted paramedics was “exceptionally confronting and heartbreaking”, he said, especially as it involved children. The girl had been uninjured but would be assessed again by paramedics and offered pastoral care once she returned to Wentworth Falls.

Experts say extreme weather around the world is being driven by climate change, made worse in South Asia by damming, deforestation and over-the-top development projects.

The Indian Meteorological Department has warned of extreme weather conditions, with a heatwave in northern parts of the country recently triggering water shortages and power cuts.

The department simultaneously warned of heavy rainfall in several other areas, including Assam and other northeastern states, and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala in the south.

A seasonally unusual deluge ahead of the annual monsoon in the northeastern state of Assam has left at least eight people dead and displaced more than 400,000 as of Wednesday.

Four of the victims were killed when their house was buried in a remote village in Dima Hasao district, where landslides undermined railway lines in several areas, making it difficult for authorities to send relief material.

One train was pushed off the tracks by muddy debris from surrounding hills.

The Indian Army, which has been brought in for rescue operations, said in a statement that it had rescued around 300 villagers as of Wednesday.

The landslide in November 2018 created a five-metre waterfall on the river north of Lillooet, and made it nearly impossible for migrating salmon to reach their spawning grounds.

Jeremy Venditti, principal investigator on the project, said his team of scientists will map the topography in the area using a laser to identify between 20 and 100 possible slide sites along the river.

“We’re looking for sites that might be sort of an imminent threat, or where an imminent slide may happen, and then we’ll also be identifying locations where they could happen,” he said in an interview Thursday.

Venditti said his team set up a field site on the same location of the 2018 slide almost a decade before that, so they’ll be able to compare their findings with the 2009 data to see how the slide changed the river and how to better predict these events.

“We felt that, as geoscientists, it was time for us to go and begin investigating where in the Fraser other landslides have happened in the past, but also (where they) will happen in the future, and the effects that they have on flow in the river, fish migration and the genetics of Fraser salmon, which we think have probably been impacted now a number of times by landslides.”

Venditti said they’ll share the information with the Fisheries Department and First Nations communities, so they can prepare for potential slides and make plans to protect the salmon.

He said possible mitigation could include engineering solutions like building fishways that can help salmon get past blocked passages.

The Fisheries Department said that 85,000 cubic metres of rock fell into the river, stopping many salmon runs from migrating.

After the remote slide was discovered, fish were transported past the site using helicopters, trucks and a so-called salmon cannon until a fish ladder was built, although the department said in July that it was still looking for a more permanent solution.

The department has said the slide is a major factor in some of the worst salmon returns on record in the Fraser River.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 12, 2022.

He noted Brazil had recently experienced similar disasters in the mountains above Rio de Janeiro, in southern Bahia state, and in Minas Gerais state.

“Unfortunately, these catastrophes happen in a continent-sized country,” he said. “We’re all obviously sad. We express our sympathy to family members. Our bigger objective is to comfort families and also, with material means, attend to the population.”

The government is moving to make funds available to municipalities that have declared a state of emergency, Daniel Ferreira, the minister of regional development, said at the press conference. He also highlighted a new credit line available to cities afflicted by such disasters.

Experts say climate change contributes to more intense rainfall, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has classified Recife’s metropolitan region as one of the world’s most vulnerable cities. The low-lying metro region is set at the delta of three rivers, features floodplains and a network of dozens of canals and is home to about 4 million people.

""As of 6:00 pm (2100 GMT) this Sunday, the number of people killed as a result of the rains has reached 79,"" the civil defense authority of Pernambuco state, where the affected communities of Recife and Olinda are located, said in a statement.

The disaster is the latest in a recent series of deadly landslides and floods triggered by extreme weather in Brazil.

The number of dead has mounted steadily over the weekend, including dozens in landslides, as heavy rains caused rivers to overflow and torrents of mud swept away everything in their path.

The latest statement from the civil defense did not offer an update on the number of people missing, though the agency had earlier reported 56 people still unaccounted for and nearly 4,000 who had lost their homes.

""We still don't have an exact number, but there are still reports of victims... who have not been found,"" Pernambuco Governor Paulo Camara said during a press conference.

""The search will continue until we can identify all the missing people,"" he said.

Authorities warned that rain was forecast to continue Monday, but in the meantime while the storm subsided some 1,200 personnel -- some in boats or helicopters -- resumed search and rescue work, state officials said.

Minister of Regional Development Daniel Ferreira urged caution in a press conference Sunday in Recife, the capital of hard-hit northeastern Pernambuco state.

""Although it has stopped raining now, we are forecasting heavy rains for the next few days,"" he said.

""So the first thing is to maintain self-protection measures.""

Between Friday night and Saturday morning, rainfall volume reached 70 percent of what was forecast for all of May in some parts of Recife.

'Difficult'

Images circulated on local media showed rescue workers and volunteers clearing heaps of debris in Jardim Monteverde, on the border between Recife and the municipality of Jaboatao dos Guararapes, where 19 died Saturday morning in a landslide that ripped through precariously built homes.

Luiz Estevao Aguiar, who lives in a different municipality, lost 11 relatives in the disaster, he told TV Globo.

""My sister, my brother-in-law, 11 people from my family died. It was difficult... I did not expect this,"" he said tearfully.

Nearby, Flavio Jose da Silva has been desperately looking for his stepfather Gilvan in the rubble of what was once his house.

Shortly after it collapsed, he heard Gilvan say, ""I'm here, under the ground.""

""We hope to find him alive,"" an emotional da Silva said, pointing to a mountain of debris.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Sunday he would travel to Recife on Monday.

Over the past year, hundreds of Brazilians have died in flooding and landslides brought on by torrential downpours.

In February, more than 230 people were killed in the city of Petropolis, the Brazilian then-empire's 19th-century summer capital, in Rio de Janeiro state.

Early last month 14 more were killed by flooding and landslides in the state.

Experts say Brazil's rainy-season downpours are being augmented by La Nina -- the cyclical cooling of the Pacific Ocean -- and by climate change.

Because a hotter atmosphere holds more water, global warming increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.

Risks from heavy rains are augmented by topography and poor construction in shantytowns built in steep areas.

According to meteorologist Estael Sias of the MetSul agency, the heavy rains lashing Pernambuco and, to a lesser extent, four other northeastern states, are the product of a typical seasonal phenomenon called ""eastern waves.""

He explained that those are areas of atmospheric disturbance that move from Africa to Brazil's northeastern coastal region.

""In other areas of the Atlantic this instability forms hurricanes, but in northeastern Brazil it has the potential for a lot of rain and even thunderstorms,"" he said.

City Councilor Mark Unlu-cay said as of Monday morning, search and retrieval operations are ongoing for the individuals that might have been trapped in their houses when the landslide occurred around midnight.

Houses have been covered in mud while the heavy downpour rendered rescue efforts difficult.

Initial information from the Bureau of Fire Protection revealed that about 80 percent of Brgy. Pilar has been damaged.

Rescuers in Abuyog are calling for more boats to speed up the transport of rescued victims since most of the road are blockaded by big boulders and uprooted trees.

More medical volunteers are also badly needed to help the medical teams attend to the injured victims.

NDRRMC Executive Director Ricardo Jalad said in a situational report that 130 deaths were still undergoing verification while seven deaths – six in Western Visayas (region 6) and one in Eastern Visayas – were already confirmed by the national disaster council.

In Leyte province, 128 people were reported dead in Baybay City and in the municipality of Abuyog where rampaging mud and soil buried several residential houses at the height of the storm earlier this week.

Aside from this, six persons in Western Visayas and three others in Davao (Region 11) were previously reported killed by the NDRRMC due to flooding and landslide.

“We are racing against time because the longer it gets, the harder it is for our rescuers to retrieve the victims,” Jalad said during a visit to Barangay Kantagnos, Baybay City on Maundy Thursday.

This will make it hard for authorities to verify the identities of the victims especially in Baybay City where 27 out of the 28 missing persons were reported, Jalad explained.

However, rescuers could not operate in certain areas in Baybay City, such as in Barangay Kantagnos, due to safety issues.

“We have to prioritize the safety of responders. We cannot penetrate the landslide area yet because the soil is still soft. It would be too dangerous for them,” the NDRRMC chief stressed.

Jalad also visited the Abuyog Community College in Abuyog town to personally oversee the situation of the evacuees, and the ongoing response operations and post-disaster activities.

“We have two primary efforts: first is to secure the welfare of evacuees which is being led by the local government units and supported by DSWD and other agencies. Second is the search, rescue and retrieval [operations] undertaken by the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, Philippine Army, Philippine Coast Guard, and response units of LGU),” he said.

Currently, the number of affected persons due to Agaton has ballooned to 494,607 families or 1,689,436 individuals.

The typhoon also displaced a total of 153,694 families or 323,306 individuals, including more than 218,000 who were staying in 1,033 evacuation centers.

The estimated cost of damage to agriculture due to Agaton was pegged at P186,632,976.31 which were incurred in Western Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao (Region 10), Soccsksargen (Region 12), and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

The Foreign Office confirmed it was “providing consular support to the family of a British couple and their children following an incident in Australia” and that it was in contact with local authorities.

New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet called the incident “tragic” and said he would be seeking advice as to whether the walking track should have been open given recent heavy rain.

“These tragedies occur too often so anything we can do to keep people safe, we will,” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

“Obviously, the Blue Mountains is a place where people love to go trekking. It’s one of the wonders of the world but when those tragedies occur it would be remiss of any government not to act.”

Following the removal of the bodies, the New South Wales Department of Environment and Heritage announced the area was closed to the public until further notice and a “comprehensive review” would be undertaken.

“(New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service) has a world class program in place to assess geotechnical risks and maintain the safety of walking tracks and other infrastructure to the greatest extent practicable,” it said in a statement.

The Wentworth Pass track is a steep and difficult 5km loop, that encompasses waterfalls and valley views and can take up to five hours to complete.

A spokesperson for the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) said the track had been inspected in the days before the incident.

“The site is currently closed and a comprehensive review will be undertaken,” they said.

“The walking track where this incident occurred was inspected in the days before the rockslide as part of a routine track assessment program.

“NPWS has a world class program in place to assess geotechnical risks and maintain the safety of walking tracks and other infrastructure to the greatest extent practicable. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict and eliminate all natural risks such as rockslides, which can occasionally occur around the state.

“All of us at NPWS extend our heartfelt sympathies to the family and those affected.”

NSW Ambulance chief superintendent Stewart Clarke told Sunrise earlier on Tuesday that all indications were that it was a “freak accident.”

“Everything we can glean from the notes during the calls [indicates] that certainly it was a freak accident.

“What was concerning more so after the fact was the concern that there were still noises being heard after the initial impact, which poses a significant risk to the patients as well as our people being sent in.”

Clarke added that a multi-agency rescue effort was launched on Monday afternoon to rescue the family, which included NSW police, Fire and Rescue NSW and NSW SES.

“These people who work tirelessly for us are the best in what they do,” Clarke said.

“They are highly trained and highly skilled but that doesn’t negate the intense risk assessments that were carried out at the time to ensure they were able to use these skills safely to access the patients to deliver some high level clinical care.”

NSW police Det Acting Supt John Nelson said: “Unfortunately there’s been a landslip while they’ve been bushwalking. It’s quite a tragic scene.”

He described the 15-year-old as being “extremely distressed”.

“Both patients have significant head and abdominal injuries requiring sedation and intubation prior to them being extricated via winch,” Clarke told reporters on Monday.



The landslip had occurred in an “extremely dangerous, extremely unstable environment”, Clarke said, describing the situation as heartbreaking.

“It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event,” Clarke said.



He described the rescue operation as “complex and delicate”, with crews working hard to access patients in rugged bushland and on unstable ground.

Blue Mountains mayor Mark Greenhill told the Guardian the local community was heartbroken by the tragedy.

“Whether resident here or not, those who come to our beautiful Blue Mountains are taken into our hearts, and moments like this cause pain and grief to our entire community.”

“This was the holiday of a lifetime for a family that came from overseas, and has ended in unspeakable tragedy, and our whole community feels this.”

While the incident did not occur on council jurisdiction, Greenhill said the Blue Mountains City Council was working with National Parks and Wildlife Service in assessing walking tracks in the area.

Significant rain is predicted later this week. “As a result, Blue Mountains national park will be closed, except for Evans and Govetts Leap lookouts, from 9am” on Wednesday, the NPWS said in a statement on Tuesday.

Greg Tannos runs Find My Australia, a sports and recreation blog, and walked the Wentworth Pass track two days before the tragic landslip, saying he didn’t see anything dangerous.

“I actually thought the trail was quite OK when we walked it. These more off the grid tracks are a little less maintained, but that’s normal, most people won’t go that far down.

“I honestly didn’t think the trail looked damaged, and it didn’t seem to be overly soggy or wet down there.”

Tannos said he was shocked to hear of a landslide on the track calling it “just a terrible tragedy”.

“We passed over a small slide, but it looked like it had been there for a few months, there was nothing dangerous. There was nothing that gave me an indication something like this would happen.

A British lawyer and his nine-year-old son were killed in a landslide while hiking in the Blue Mountains, Australia, media reports said.



Mehraab Nazir, 49, and his family were on a trip to Sydney from their home base in Singapore. They moved from London more than 10 years ago, reports added. The tragic landslide on Monday (4) came after a week of torrential rainfall in the area.

Nazir’s wife Anastasia, 40, 14-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter were rescued from the scene. According to reports, the two teenagers have been reunited with their godmother while their mother remains in a critical condition in hospital.

Reports highlighted that the 15-year-old daughter escaped the landslide physically unscathed and raised the alarm in a frantic call to emergency services at around 1.30pm. Hailed as a ‘hero’, she walked from the scene with the help of emergency crews, which involved trekking for an hour-and-a-half along the hiking track.

After the bodies of Nazir and his son were removed from the area on Tuesday (5), the New South Wales Department of Environment and Heritage announced a “comprehensive review” into what happened would take place.

Nazir was a partner in law firm Watson Farley & Williams. He was specialised in complex cross-border finance transactions with a particular focus on the transportation and energy sectors.

Some of Nazir’s relatives have already arrived in Sydney while others are still making the trip.

The family are part of the Zoroastrian religion, one of the world’s oldest faiths which is based in Iran and follows the teachings of the ancient prophet Zoroaster.

A member of the religious community said they’re mourning such a ‘tragic loss’.

“While we all still come to terms with this immense tragedy, the outpour and generosity of our community is very heart-warming,” said a spokesman from the Australian Zoroastrian Association. “There is much grief among both the London and Sydney Zoroastrian community for this family tragedy.”

British High Commissioner to Australia Vicki Treadell issued a statement early on Wednesday (6) confirming she is assisting the family.

Media reports said that the family were permitted to use the advanced Wentworth Pass track, famous for its stunning waterfall views and valley lookouts, despite weeks of wild weather making the area dangerous for hikers.

Authorities are still working to determine whether the landslide fell on the group while they were walking along a bush track, or if they were trekking along the cliff face that fell.

Rio de Janeiro has been hit by inclement weather over the past few weeks. Landslides and flooding in February killed some 240 people in the Petropolis area, in the hills above Rio de Janeiro, authorities said on March 23.

“We have more than 70 homeless families. We are providing shelters and renting hostels for these people,” Luciano Vidal, the mayor of Paraty, told Reuters.

He said mudslides blocked streets and isolated parts of the city, and entire neighborhoods were without electricity in the colonial coastal town that is a tourist attraction.

In one day, Paraty received 322 millimeter (12.68 inches) of rain, the rainfall average for six months. At least seven people died there, Vidal said. The civil defense statement only confirmed five deaths in Paraty.

The town, a tourist destination, declared a state of emergency as more rains were forecast.

In nearby Angra dos Reis, also a tourist destination hit by heavy rainfall, at least sixpeople died, the latest state tally showed.

Water poured through the city of Durban and surrounding areas in KwaZulu-Natal province on Tuesday. Local officials expect the death toll to rise after a number of people were swept away.

Several hundred people have lost their homes and belongings, and electricity has been cut off to a number of areas.

The city’s port, the largest and busiest in sub-Saharan Africa, and major highways suffered major damage due to sustained rainfall which burst banks of rivers and led to surging waters. Dozens of shipping containers were pictured in the floodwaters, buckled and cracked open.

Transnet, which runs the Durban port, said in a statement that operations had been suspended due to the extreme downpours and high winds.

South Africa’s military has been deployed to Durban and the surrounding eThekwini metropolitan area on Tuesday to help with rescue efforts locally.

More heavy rain was forecast in the coastal city through this evening.

Recent extreme rainfall in southeast Africa has become more intense and damaging due to the climate crisis, a team of international scientists reported earlier this week.

The World Weather Attribution (WWA) group said that climate change made destructive downpours more likely during back-to-back storms in Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique in early 2022.

Between January and March, southeast Africa was hit by three tropical cyclones and two tropical storms in just six weeks – with more than a million people affected by extreme rainfall and severe flooding, and some 230 recorded deaths.

“Again we are seeing how the people with the least responsibility for climate change are bearing the brunt of the impacts,” said Dr Friederike Otto, who is part of the WWA which analyses the links beween climate change and extreme weather events.

“Rich countries should honour their commitments and increase much-needed funding for adaptation, and for compensating the victims of extreme events driven by climate change with loss and damage payments.”",landslide,downpour,Durban,-29.857559999999978,31.027810000000045,14.558,2022-04-05 00:00:00,2022-04-05 23:59:59,12.0,45,2022-04-05,11:59:00

The drama took place when heavy rain fell on northern Wyoming and southern Montana on Sunday, causing record-breaking flooding into Monday and Tuesday.

A video shared to social media by Twitter user Anne Leopold showed one SUV approaching a turn on a road while rock slabs fell from the slope above.

Pieces of rock smashed and broke around the SUV, which Ms Leopold said had occupants inside who “seemed okay” despite some rock appearing to strike the vehicle.

Both the SUV and the Twitter user, who was filming the drive out of Yellowstone, had been heading towards the northern gate by Gardiner -- a Montana town badly affected by the water levels.

Only one road out of the tourist town remains open, according to Mike Skelton, the president of the local chamber of commerce.

He told KULR-8 news on Wednesday: “As you know being down here, there were several thousand visitors that were stuck here in Gardiner and couldn’t get out through the park, couldn’t get out through Highway 89”.

Roughly 10,000 people have been evacuated from Yellowstone since Sunday as floodwaters submerged critical bits of infrastructure and popular trails. Only a group of campers remains, officials said.

Residents of neighbouring towns have meanwhile taken-in thousands of visitors and power supplies continue to be affected, as does drinking water. A number of homes and buildings have also been damaged but no fatalities have been reported.

Some 87 people have been rescued by the Montana National Guard following the declaration of a disaster by state governor Greg Gianforte, the agency said on Wednesday.

Water levels in some parts are falling but according to the National Weather Service in Billings, Montana, the flood remains at the highest warning level, of 16ft.

All five park entrances were closed to inbound traffic for the first summer since a series of devastating wildfires in 1988. The National Park Service was working to reach visitors and staff remaining at various locations, especially in the hardest-hit northern flank of Yellowstone, officials said.

“Our first priority has been to evacuate the northern section of the park where we have multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues,” the park superintendent, Cam Sholly, said in a statement.

The “gateway” community of Gardiner, Montana, just north of the park’s northern boundary and home to many Yellowstone staff members, has been cut off due to a mudslide in the vicinity, according to the National Park Service.

Electric power was knocked out in multiple areas of the park, and preliminary assessments showed numerous sections of roads throughout Yellowstone either washed away or covered in rocks and mud, with a number of bridges also damaged, the park service said.

Various roads in the park’s southern tier were on the verge of being flooded, according to the agency.

The flooding and slides were triggered by days of torrential showers in the park and steady rains across much of the wider region after one of its wettest springs in many years. The park service characterized the levels of rainfall and flooding sweeping the park as unprecedented.

A sudden spike in summer temperatures during the past three days also has hastened melting and runoff of snow accumulated in the park’s higher elevations from late-winter storms.

The disaster poses a huge logistical challenge for Afghanistan's new Taliban government, which has isolated itself from much of the world by introducing hardline Islamist rule that subjugates women and girls.

The aid-dependent country saw the bulk of its foreign assistance cut off in the wake of the Taliban takeover last August, and even before the earthquake the United Nations warned of a humanitarian crisis that threatened the entire population.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the global agency has ""fully mobilised"" to help, deploying health teams and supplies of medicine, food, trauma kits and emergency shelter to the quake zone.

Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted Thursday that aid flights had landed from Qatar and Iran, while Pakistan had sent trucks carrying tents, medical supplies and food across the land border.

The earthquake struck areas that were already suffering the effects of heavy rain, causing rockfalls and mudslides that wiped out hamlets perched precariously on mountain slopes.

Alejando Murat said rivers overflowed their banks and swept away people in homes, while other victims were buried under mud and rocks.

“There were fundamentally two reasons” for the deaths, Murat told local media. “There were rivers that overflowed, and on the other hand, and the most serious part, were landslides.”

Murat said the deaths appeared to be concentrated in a number of small towns in the mountains, just inland from the coast. But he said there were also reports of three children missing near the resort of Huatulco.

Agatha made history as the strongest hurricane ever recorded to come ashore in May during the eastern Pacific hurricane season.

It made landfall on Monday afternoon on a sparsely populated stretch of small beach towns and fishing villages in Oaxaca.

It was a strong Category 2 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 105mph, but it quickly lost power moving inland over the mountainous interior. Remnants of Agatha were moving north-east on Tuesday into Veracruz state.

Murat said power had been restored to some communities near the coast, but that some bridges had been washed out and mudslides blocked a number of highways. San Isidro del Palmar, only a couple miles inland from the coast, was swamped by the Tonameca river that flows through town.

Residents waded through neck-deep water to salvage what items they could from their homes, walking gingerly with piles of clothing atop their heads and religious figures in their arms.

Argeo Aquino, who has lived in the town his whole life, said he could recall only two other occasions when he saw such flooding. “The houses are totally flooded, so they are getting everything out,” Aquino said Monday as he watched his neighbours. “There are stores, houses. More than anything else, we have to try to save all the good material, because everything else is going to be washed away.”

The Tonameca’s brown waters reached the windows of parked cars and the minibuses used for local transportation.

Nearby, heavy rain and high winds lashed the beach town of Zipolite, known for its clothing-optional beach and bohemian vibe. The wind howled for about six hours on Monday, said Silvia Ranfagni, manager of the Casa Kalmar hotel in Zipolite.

All entrances to Yellowstone National Park were closed Monday and would be through at least Wednesday as heavy rain falling on melting snow caused significant flooding and road damage, park officials announced.

Calling it “extremely hazardous conditions,” authorities evacuated the northern portion of the park due to flooding, rockslides and mudslides caused by record rainfall.

Park officials announced on Monday afternoon that the park would be closed to visitors until at least Wednesday.

“Red Lodge, Montana, is a river right now and we have some flooding on the west of Cody,” Cody Beers, a Wyoming Department of Transportation spokesman, told Cowboy State Daily. “I’ve never heard of Yellowstone closing the entire park to inbound traffic, though.”

Footage from the storms showed roads collapsing into raging rivers and logs piled high on the shores.

The electricity was out in several areas of the park as of Monday morning.

All inbound traffic to the park was halted until conditions stabilized and park officials could assess damage to the roads, bridges and other facilities. The visitors turned away included those with lodging and camping reservations.

Many of the park roads could be closed for an extended period of time, according to park officials.

“It’s just been multiple days of rain up in this area, plus we had snow on Memorial Day weekend,” Beers said. “It’s a rare day when we have water levels that reached the bottom of our bridges.”

Cowboy State Daily meteorologist Don Day said flood advisories surround Yellowstone because of the “huge amount of snow” coupled with the significant rain.

“I don’t think anyone thought the runoff would be as big as this,” he said.

Beers said WYDOT will continue to monitor the weather events in the northwestern portion of the state and how they might affect roads.

He recommended anyone traveling toward Yellowstone wait a day or two for officials to figure out how long certain roads will be closed and whether the rainfall in the area will continue.

“Be careful out there, because Mother Nature’s fury is showing itself right now,” Beers said.

Yellowstone superintendent Cam Sholly said on Monday that staff’s first priority was to evacuate the northern section of the park, where there were multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues.

“The community of Gardiner is currently isolated, and we are working with the county and State of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas,” Sholly said. “Due to predictions of higher flood levels in areas of the park’s southern loop, in addition to concerns with water and wastewater systems, we will begin to move visitors in the southern loop out of the park later today in coordination with our in-park business partners.”

Sholly said it was likely the northern loop of the park would be closed for a substantial amount of time.

“I appreciate the efforts of the Yellowstone team and partners to safely evacuate areas of the park and of our gateway community partners who are helping us through this major event,” he said. “We appreciate the support offered by the Department of Interior, National Park Service and the Montana and Wyoming governors.”

ST. GEORGE — A significant rock slide occurred in Zion National Park on Tuesday morning around 9 a.m. and covered part of a road.

Zion Canyon Scenic Drive, north of the Grotto, was blocked and shuttle buses could not pass the slide, said Jonathan Shafer, Zion National Park public affairs specialist.

Within 30 minutes, however, the Zion Canyon Scenic Scenic Drive north of the Grotto was reopened and remains open. The rocks have been cleared and buses are running again. Shafer cautioned that pedestrians should avoid the area today.

One of the larger rock slides in Zion National Park occurred in August 2019 bove the Weeping Rock shuttle stop in the main canyon. According to St. George News, the immense rockslide injured three people, and several others were temporarily stranded. A large slab of Navajo Sandstone detached from Cable Mountain almost 2,000 vertical feet above the Weeping Rock parking lot.

At the time, the 2019 rockslide closed some popular hiking trails, including Weeping Rock trail, Observation Point Trail and Hidden Canyon Trail. For the latest updates on the park visit the Zion National Park website.

At least one cruise ship diverted from Skagway after the slide damaged part of the Railroad Dock.

Cruise ships are either using other docks or taking passengers by tenders to the nearby Small Boat Harbor, Jacqueline Taylor-Rose, a spokesperson for the White Pass & Yukon Route Railroad said in an email to The Associate Press. The dock is owned by the rail line.

There were no injuries in the slide, she said.

Engineers arrived later Thursday to begin assessing the slide area. The dock remains closed to passenger and vehicle traffic.

After the hillside is evaluated, work will begin to repair pier damage.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The death toll from landslides and floods that hit the central and southern Philippines after a summer tropical depression unleashed days of pounding rain has risen to at least 43, with 28 others missing, officials said Tuesday.

More than 100 villagers were injured in landslides in the hard-hit city of Baybay in central Leyte province over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing villagers.

“We are saddened by this dreadful incident that caused an unfortunate loss of lives and destruction of properties,” said army brigade commander Col. Noel Vestuir, who was helping oversee the search and rescue.

Thirty-six of the dead were recovered from the landslides that hit six Baybay villages, military and local officials said. Seven other people drowned in floodwaters in the central provinces of Samar and Negros Oriental and southern Davao de Oro and Davao Oriental provinces.

More rescuers and heavy equipment, including backhoes, arrived in the landslide-hit villages in Baybay, but continuing rain and muddy ground have hampered the efforts. “The challenge is, it’s continuing to rain and we cannot immediately clear the landslide areas,” Vestuir said.

Coast guard, police and firefighters rescued some villagers Monday in flooded central communities, including some who were trapped on their roofs. In central Cebu city, schools and work were suspended Monday and Mayor Michael Rama declared a state of calamity to allow the rapid release of emergency funds.

At least 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year, mostly during the rainy season that begins around June. Some storms have hit even during the scorching summer months in recent years.

“I gathered my children in our house in Brgy. Maypatag (Ambuhan) from our other house in the barrio in preparation for my birthday. I was supposed to slaughter a pig for the celebration. We were happy before this happened,” recalled Mejia.

He said they were awakened by a loud rumbling noise around 3 a.m. on Monday (April 11) in what turned out to be an experience so tragic and so painful.

“When my wife and son got up, we were blown away by the mud coming from the mountain,” he recalled.

One of his sons was saved when he covered himself under their refrigerator that leaned to the wall.

“I heard my children crying for help. I told my son to call for help while I dug through the mud to save them,” he narrated.

He said that because of the landslide, it took time before the villagers came to help him rescue his children.

“At first I could hear one of them calling for help (Tabang) for about 20 minutes. I tried digging with my bare hands with no light until her voice stopped, then another one cried for help,” he narrated.

Remigio was able to save one of them. However, his 16-year-old daughter and 8-year-old granddaughter were already dead when they found them. That broke his heart.

He said the village chief of Brgy. Imelda was kind enough to allow them to have the vigil in the Brgy. Hall, and let them sleep there together with the families of the other victims.

Meanwhile, Mantesa Polvera and her sister Karen Joy, who both came home from Luzon could also not believe that their whole family was buried alive in the landslide in Brgy. Mailhi.

While they were attending the wake of their mother, three siblings, and two nieces, they found out that their father’s body has been recovered from the rubble.

Their uncle and one other relative remain missing.

Aside from grieving the loss of their loved ones, Mantesa and her siblings are having trouble finding the money for the burial of their family members who perished.

They were grateful for Bernandino Tacoy of BGT Cares Foundation who arrived from a relief operation to the evacuees and extended burial assistance to them.

Scores of people are still missing and feared dead after the strongest storm to strike the archipelago nation this year dumped heavy rain over several days, forcing tens of thousands into evacuation centres.

In the central province of Leyte — the worst affected by Agaton— devastating landslides smashed farming and fishing communities, wiping out houses and transforming the landscape.

The disaster-prone region is regularly ravaged by storms — including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013 — with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of climate change.

Emergency personnel in Abuyog have retrieved dozens of bodies from the coastal village of Pilar, which was destroyed by a landslide on Tuesday.

At least 42 people died in landslides that hit three villages in the municipality, police said. Another person drowned.

Most of those deaths were in Pilar, with at least 28 bodies brought by boat to a sandy lot near the municipal government building after roads leading to the settlement were cut off by landslides.

More than 100 remained missing, and Abuyog Mayor Lemuel Traya told AFP there was little hope of finding anyone else alive.

An aerial photo showed a wide stretch of mud and earth that had swept down a mountain to the sea, crushing everything in its path.

The wreckage of houses and debris was scattered along the shore.

Bad weather and thick mud had complicated retrieval efforts in Pilar, where the ground was unstable. Searchers were also combing the coastline after some bodies were swept kilometres away by ocean currents.

“This will not end soon, it could go on for days,” Traya warned.

Many of those who died had hiked to higher ground to avoid flash floods, villagers told AFP.

“It sounded like a helicopter,” said Pilar councillor Anacleta Canuto, 44, describing the noise made by the landslide.

Canuto, her husband and their two children survived, but they lost at least nine relatives.

Pilar fisherman Santiago Dahonog, 38, said he rushed into the sea with two siblings and a nephew as the landslide hurtled towards them.

“We got out of the house, ran to the water and started swimming,” he told AFP. “I was the only survivor.”

Scores missing in Baybay

Another 101 people were killed and dozens injured in vegetable, rice and coconut-growing villages around Baybay City at the weekend, local authorities said. At least 103 are still missing.

The hardest hit was Kantagnos, where 42 people died and 93 have not been found.

In the nearby village of Bunga, 17 people perished when sodden soil shot down a hill and slammed into the riverside community. Only a few rooftops are visible in the mud, which has started to smell of rotting flesh.

Three people also drowned on the main southern island of Mindanao, and one person died in the central province of Iloilo, the national disaster agency said in its latest update.

Another three deaths previously reported in the central province of Negros Oriental were dropped from the tally after they were found to be unrelated to the storm.

“Agaton” struck at the beginning of Holy Week, one of the most important holidays in the mainly Catholic nation, when thousands travel to visit relatives.

It came four months after a super typhoon devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

The Philippines — ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change — is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi – the strongest to hit the archipelago this year – were in the central province of Leyte, where a series of landslides devastated communities.

Eighty six of the casualties were in Baybay, a mountainous area in the province, where 236 people were also injured, the city government said in a report. Waves of sodden soil had smashed into farming settlements in Baybay city.

Twenty-six people died and about 150 were missing in the coastal village of Pilar, which is part of Abuyog municipality, after a torrent of mud and earth on Tuesday pushed houses into the sea and buried most of the settlement, authorities said.

“I have to be honest, we are no longer expecting survivors,” Abuyog mayor Lemuel Traya said, adding that emergency personnel were now focused on the difficult task of retrieving bodies.

About 250 people were in evacuation centres after being rescued by boat after roads were cut by landslides, he said. A number of villagers were also in hospital.

A rumbling sound like “a helicopter” alerted Ara Mae Canuto, 22, to the landslide hurtling towards her family’s home in Pilar. She said she tried to outrun it but was swept into the water and nearly drowned.

“I swallowed dirt, and my ears and nose are full of mud,” Canuto said by phone from her hospital bed. Her father died and her mother has not been found.

Megi, which made landfall on Sunday with sustained winds of up to 65kph and gusts of up to 80kph, has since dissipated.

The disaster-prone region is regularly ravaged by storms – including a direct hit from super typhoon Haiyan in 2013 – with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of human-driven climate change.

Aerial photos showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga village, where only a few rooftops poked through the now-transformed landscape.

“We were told to be on alert because a storm was coming, but they did not directly tell us we needed to evacuate,” said Bunga farmworker Loderica Portarcos, 47, who lost 17 relatives and a friend in the landslide.

Portarcos braved heat and humidity as she advised a backhoe operator where to dig for three bodies still embedded in the soft soil, which had started to smell of rotting flesh.

“Our dead relatives are all in the morgue, but there will be no time for a wake to mourn them because the mayor told us they smell bad,” she said.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Black body bags containing 26 victims from Pilar were laid out on sand in Abuyog for relatives to identify on Wednesday.

The Abuyog police chief, Captain James Mark Ruiz, said more boats were needed, but getting access to the shore was difficult.

Photos posted by the Bureau of Fire Protection on Facebook showed buildings crushed or turned over by the force of the landslide and debris in the water.

“We’re using fiberglass boats, and there are steel bars exposed in the sea, so it’s very difficult,” Abuyog Mayor Traya said, adding that the ground was unstable and “very risky”.

While Pilar survivor Canuto counts herself lucky to be alive, she said “many of us died and a lot are missing, too”.

Pope Francis expressed solidarity with the victims, the Vatican said in a statement.

“He also offers the assurance of prayers for the dead, injured and displaced as well as those engaged in recovery efforts,” it said. “His Holiness willingly invokes upon all the Filipino people God’s blessings.”

Whipping up seas, Megi forced dozens of ports to temporarily suspend operations, stranding thousands of people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year in the Philippines.

It came four months after super typhoon Rai devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Of the victims, 156 were from Leyte province, some 600 kilometres south-east of Manila, where landslides devastated communities in Baybay City and Abuyog town.

At least 104 people were still missing in the two areas, the agency said.

In other affected areas, 16 people were also killed mostly in floods caused by tropical storm Megi, which slammed into the country on April 10, it added.

More than 2 million people in 30 provinces were affected by the storm, which forced more than 207,500 residents to flee their homes and stay in evacuation centre.

Damage to agriculture, houses and public infrastructure was estimated at more than 257 million pesos (5 million dollars), the agency said.

Efforts to search for the missing were continuing despite concerns over the safety of rescuers in the landslide areas, said Mark Timbal, a spokesman for the national disaster agency.

""So far, our search and rescue teams did not stop their operations,"" he told DZBB radio station in Manila. ""More than 300 search and rescue personnel have been deployed to help the victims.""

In Abuyog, 32 persons, 29 of whom were residents of Barangay Pilar, had been retrieved.

The number of fatalities in the two landslide-hit areas was expected to increase as retrieval operations continued.

Anamelle Bantaculo, village councilor of Kantagnos, one of the worst-hit areas in Baybay, appealed for help, especially food, water, medicine, blanket, and even tarpaulin for residents, who survived the mudslide but lost their homes.

“Our gymnasium is now occupied by 65 families. I’m asking people to help us even by providing tents for affected families, especially those who lost their homes,” she said.

In Abuyog, about 43 kilometers away from Baybay City, 32 people died due to a landslide.

Fr. Amadeo Alvero of the Palo Archdiocese and part of the Caritas in Palo said he did not expect the tragedy to happen.

“I talked to some survivors who thought they could not survive. Indeed most of them were still shocked. Many of them shared that they made a great run for them to survive. And they prayed hard, calling God to spare their lives,” he said.

“Many are still waiting for the missing members of their families as the rescuers continue to retrieve bodies from the rubbles,” he added.

Residents believed 177 persons were missing from Pilar, a village located at the foot of a mountain where the landslide originated.

On Wednesday, Social Welfare Secretary Rolando Joselito Bautista visited Baybay City and went to the villages of Bunga and Katagnos where he extended financial assistance to affected families.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi – the strongest to hit the disaster-prone archipelago this year – were in the central province of Leyte where a series of landslides devastated communities.

At least 47 people died and 27 were missing after waves of sodden soil smashed into farming settlements around Baybay City over the weekend, local authorities said. Just over 100 people were injured.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Search operations for survivors in Pilar village – part of Abuyog municipality in Leyte – resumed at first light Wednesday, with boats carrying rescuers to the coastal community of around 400 people a day after a landslide pushed most houses into the sea.

“We have five casualties, one unidentified,” Captain James Mark Ruiz of Abuyog police told AFP.

Around 50 survivors have been rescued from the village, the Bureau of Fire Protection said on Facebook Tuesday.

Raymark Lasco, a radio operator at the Abuyog disaster agency, told AFP that “many people” had died.

“I can’t give you exact details... because our operation is ongoing,” he said.

Port operations suspended

Search operations have also resumed around Baybay City after the rain stopped, enabling emergency personnel to access hard-hit areas, Mayor Jose Carlos Cari told CNN Philippines.

“In some barangays (villages), we’re just doing retrieval,” Cari said.

Rescuers have been using their bare hands and shovels to reach victims buried by the landslides.

A Philippine Coast Guard video shared on Facebook Tuesday showed rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher from one of the devastated villages, while other victims were piggybacked to safety.

The military has joined coast guard, police and fire protection personnel in the search and rescue efforts, which have been hampered by bad weather.

Whipping up seas, Megi forced dozens of ports to suspend operations and stranded thousands of people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year in the Philippines.

Megi came four months after super typhoon Rai devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Scientists have long warned that typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the planet becomes warmer due to climate change.

The Philippines – ranked among the most vulnerable nations to its impacts – is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

Scores of people are still missing and feared dead after the strongest storm to strike the archipelago nation this year dumped heavy rain over several days, forcing tens of thousands into evacuation centers.

In the central province of Leyte — the worst affected by Agaton — devastating landslides smashed farming and fishing communities, wiping out houses and transforming the landscape.

The disaster-prone region is regularly ravaged by storms — including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013 — with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of human-driven climate change.

Emergency personnel in Abuyog municipality have retrieved dozens of bodies from a coastal village destroyed by a landslide on Tuesday.

At least 26 people were killed and around 150 are missing, authorities said, with little hope of finding anyone else alive.

Many of those who died had hiked up the mountain to avoid flash floods, villagers told AFP.

“It sounded like a helicopter,” said Pilar councilor Anacleta Canuto, 44, describing the noise made by the landslide.

Canuto and her husband and their two children survived, but they lost at least nine relatives.

Pilar fisherman Santiago Dahonog, 38, said he rushed into the sea with two siblings and a nephew as the landslide hurtled towards them.

“We got out of the house, ran to the water and started swimming,” he told AFP. “I was the only survivor.”

Another 86 people were killed and dozens injured in vegetable, rice and coconut-growing villages around Baybay City last weekend, local authorities said. At least 117 are still missing.

The hardest hit was Kantagnos where 32 people died and 103 have not been found.

In the nearby village of Bunga, 17 people perished when a wave of sodden soil swept down a hill and slammed into the riverside community. Only a few rooftops are visible in the mud.

Three people also drowned on the main southern island of Mindanao, the national disaster agency said in its latest update.

Another three deaths previously reported in the central province of Negros Oriental were dropped from the tally after they were found to be unrelated to the storm.

Further rainfall on subsequent days increased these totals by up to 150mm in regions around Durban, which exacerbated flooding problems.

More than 100 villagers were injured in landslides in the hard-hit city of Baybay in central Leyte province over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing villagers.

“We are saddened by this dreadful incident that caused an unfortunate loss of lives and destruction of properties,” said army brigade commander Col. Noel Vestuir, who was helping oversee the search and rescue.

Thirty-six of the dead were recovered from the landslides that hit six Baybay villages, military and local officials said. Seven other people drowned in floodwaters in the central provinces of Samar and Negros Oriental and southern Davao de Oro and Davao Oriental provinces.

More rescuers and heavy equipment, including backhoes, arrived in the landslide-hit villages in Baybay, but continuing rain and muddy ground have hampered the efforts. “The challenge is, it’s continuing to rain and we cannot immediately clear the landslide areas,” Vestuir said.

Coast guard, police and firefighters rescued some villagers Monday in flooded central communities, including some who were trapped on their roofs. In central Cebu city, schools and work were suspended Monday and Mayor Michael Rama declared a state of calamity to allow the rapid release of emergency funds.

At least 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year, mostly during the rainy season that begins around June. Some storms have hit even during the scorching summer months in recent years.

The disaster-prone Southeast Asian nation also lies on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where many of the world’s volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.

More than 17,000 people fled their homes as the storm pummelled the disaster-prone region in recent days, flooding houses, severing roads and knocking out power.

At least 21 people were dead after landslides slammed into several villages in Leyte province -- one of the hardest hit by the storm -- local authorities said.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Photos showed the rooftops of several homes in Bunga, one of the Leyte communities affected, poking above a river of mud.

Rescue efforts were focused on the nearby village of Kantagnos, which an official said had been hit by two landslides.

Some residents managed to escape or were pulled out of the mud alive, but many are still feared trapped.

Five people have been confirmed dead in Kantagnos, but it is not clear how many are still missing.

A Philippine Coast Guard video shared on Facebook showed six rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher to safety.

“There was a small landslide and some people were able to run to safety, and then a big one followed which covered the entire village,” Jose Carlos Cari, mayor of Leyte’s Baybay City, told local broadcaster DZMM Teleradyo.

“We’re looking for many people, there are 210 households there.”

Cari said the bad weather was hampering rescue efforts.

“We’re pushing, but we’re having a hard time because it’s dangerous,” he said.

“Equipment has been mobilised, everything is ready, but we’re unable to move because it’s still raining heavily and rivers are still swollen.”

The military has joined coast guard, police and fire protection officers in the search and rescue efforts.

National disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal said landslides around Baybay City had reached settlements “outside the danger zone”, catching many people by surprise.

“There were people in their homes that were hit directly by the landslide,” Timbal told AFP.

Tropical storm Megi -- known in the Philippines by its local name Agaton -- is the first major storm to hit the country this year.

Whipping up seas, it forced dozens of ports to suspend operations and stranded nearly 8,000 people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year.

The Philippines re-opened to fully vaccinated tourists from most countries in February after lifting practically all Covid-19 restrictions, and Easter is a popular holiday for domestic tourists.

The storm comes four months after a super typhoon devastated swathes of the archipelago nation, killing more than 400 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Scientists have long warned typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer due to climate change.

The Philippines -- ranked among the most vulnerable nations to its impacts -- is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

Torrential rains have triggered flash floods and landslides across Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state, killing at least eight people including six children and leaving 13 missing, authorities said on Saturday.

Two days of heavy rain have battered a broad swath of the southeastern state’s Atlantic coast, the latest in a series of deadly storms in Brazil that experts have said are being aggravated by climate change.

The latest floods and landslides come six weeks after flash floods and landslides killed 233 people in the scenic city of Petropolis, the Brazilian empire’s 19th-century summer capital, also in Rio state.

This time, the areas hit hardest included the tourist town of Paraty, a seaside colonial city known for its picturesque cobblestone streets and colourful houses.

Officials on Saturday there said a landslide in the Ponta Negra neighbourhood had killed a mother and five of her children, ages two, five, eight, 10 and 15.

A sixth child was rescued alive and taken to the hospital, they said.

In all, seven houses were swept away in landslides in the city, and another four people injured. Seventy-one families were forced from their homes, officials said.

Two more victims were killed in the cities of Mesquita and Angra dos Reis, where another 13 people remain missing, said Congressman Marcelo Freixo, who represents the state of 17.5 million people.

In Angra, the victim was a four-year-old girl buried in a landslide, while in Mesquita, 40km (25 miles) northwest of Rio de Janeiro city, a 38-year-old man was electrocuted trying to help another person escape the flooding, media reports said.

The storms turned streets into rivers in several cities on Friday night, sweeping up cars and triggering landslides – a frequent tragedy in the rainy season, especially in poor hillside communities.

Officials in Angra said the city had received 655 millimetres (26 inches) of rain in 48 hours, “levels never before registered in the municipality”.

The federal government said it had sent military aircraft to help the local rescue effort, and dispatched national disaster response secretary Alexandre Lucas to the state.

Experts have said rainy season downpours in Brazil are being augmented by La Nina – the cyclical cooling of the Pacific Ocean – and by the impact of climate change.

As a hotter atmosphere holds more water, global warming increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.

In January, torrential rain triggered floods and landslides that killed at least 28 people in southeastern Brazil, mostly in Sao Paulo state.

A study published Friday in Science Advances found that under a high- emissions scenario—in a world where we do nothing to stop current levels of emissions—the frequency of back-to-back wildfires and rainfall events would increase seven times by 2100 in the Pacific Northwest and become twice as likely in California. The combo of fire and rain sets the stage for landslides , which can sweep away homes in an instant.

“We know those things are happening anyway, so let’s think about how likely it is within a single year both of them would happen—a fire, and then a rainstorm afterwards,” Samantha Stevenson, an assistant professor of environmental science at University of California, Santa Barbara and a coauthor of the study, told Earther. “We care about that because that has a much bigger impact than either of those things just happening individually.”

Both wildfires and heavy rainfall can be devastating on their own, but when rain falls on areas that haven’t fully recovered from fire, the effects can be catastrophic. Wildfires burn off a crucial layer of vegetation that helps to capture some of the water during rainfall, slowing down the water on its way into the soil. When heavy rains fall on areas scarred by wildfires, that barrier doesn’t exist, making debris flows (the more scientifically appropriate name for “mud slides,” since a lot of stuff besides mud can get caught up in the currents) much more likely. Fires also change the chemical composition of the soil itself, causing runoff to increase and upping the likelihood of severe erosion in certain areas.

T he study, which uses climate modeling to run different scenarios, examines the chance that wildfires and rainfall will coexist in a certain time period. “If you have two sets of dice, and one is for fire weather, and one is for rain, you could roll those independently, and some of the time you’d come up with, say, a six, and you’d get extreme fire or extreme rainfall,” Stevenson said. “That would happen by chance anyway. But what climate change is doing is loading those dice, so you’re more likely to get those extreme values.”

The findings aren’t particularly surprising; t he IPCC report published last year clearly laid the links between climate change supercharging rainstorms as well as helping wildfires get bigger and more destructive. B ut they’re extremely worrisome, given how devastating extreme rainfall can be to areas that have recently burned. Folks in the Pacific Northwest got a taste of what this future could look like last fall, when an atmospheric river dumped a torrent of rain on parts of British Columbia that had suffered through wildfires that summer. Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from towns and cities in the region, while at one point every major highway out of Vancouver was closed. Officials had to rescue nearly 300 people, including dozens of children, off a highway after they became trapped overnight by water, rocks, and mud.

Importantly, the study’s findings operate under a “business as usual” emissions scenario— projections that do not take into account any sort of climate action whatsoever and which are (hopefully) an overshoot of what actually will happen at the end of the century as the world tries to take decisive climate action now. However, even if the doomsday numbers the report projects are an overshoot, climate change has already upped the risk of wildfires and rainfall occurring in tandem.

“The increase in risk is already here,” Stevenson said. “It will get worse than it is now—the question is just by how much.”",debris_flow,rain,"California, Santa Barbara",34.41938000000005,-119.69904999999994,9.797,2021-09-01 00:00:00,2021-11-30 23:59:59,1092.0,,2021-10-16,11:59:00

Rain showers began Thursday, leading to deadly landslides in the region. The volume of rain registered in the last 48 hours was the highest on record in Angra dos Reis, according to the city's municipal government.

Officials told affiliate CNN Brazil on Saturday that a landslide in the town of Paraty killed at least eight people -- a father and seven of his children -- ages 2 to 17. A seventh child was rescued and transported to a hospital, municipal officials told the affiliate.

At least four other people were injured -- none seriously -- after seven houses were hit by landslides in the coastal community of Ponta Negra, according to officials in Paraty. More than 22 neighborhoods sustained flooding and 71 families were displaced.

In the municipality of Mesquita, a 38-year-old man was electrocuted to death after three days of heavy rainfall, CNN Brazil reported.

Unfortunately, more and more keep popping up across the City of Pittsburgh.

KDKA Investigator Meghan Schiller wanted to find out how many landslides are on the city's list for monitoring and if the list is growing faster than in years past.

Only on KDKA: we took concerned residents' questions straight to Eric Setzler, the City of Pittsburgh's lead engineer.

KDKA first reported on the El Paso Street slide in Morningside on Feb. 16, but its appearance has deteriorated in the past month and a half. Setzler tells KDKA it's up next for repairs.

We interviewed concerned neighbors along El Paso Street in Morningside who tell KDKA that the mailman and delivery trucks are struggling to maneuver the narrowing roadway.

""It stopped at the bottom of my deck and the deck tipped over,"" said neighbor Collen Crnkovich.

We highlighted the disappearing Bon Air backyards along Drycove Street and talked to neighbors who fear the city will condemn their homes as their legal bills pile up.

""I have no place to go during the wintertime, during the pandemic,"" said neighbor Mary Kaye-Kienke.

State Rep. Emily Kinkead is pushing for funding to help homeowners like Kaye-Kienke stuck with high bills to repair landslides on their properties. She previously proposed House Bill 1054, hoping to create a way to help these homeowners since no home insurance will cover the cost.

""We don't have anything, like nothing exists to help people recover,"" said Kinkead.

Jersey barriers recently popped up on Andover Terrace in North Oakland. Neighbors say the street is shifting and pulling away from the sidewalk.

""I hope they're gonna fix it after all,"" said neighbor Della Pennywell.

It's a safety issue with no quick fix.

""Whoever owns the land that slides is responsible for fixing the landslide,"" said Setzler.

He admits it's not something in the budget for most homeowners.

""I mean it's hard enough for the city to have enough resources to fix these landslides, how can you expect the typical homeowner?"" he said.

But if the slide involves city property, like a street, stairs or ""right of way,"" it's his department's responsibility. He's tracking more than 100 slides right now.

""Probably in the range of 120 landslides that we're aware of and not all of those necessarily require any action,"" said Setzler. ""We have 75 that we're monitoring or keeping an eye on.""

It's expensive to do the research, complete a design and initiate the fix. Setzler tells KDKA the city's spending about $5 million each year to fix the slides.

""And honestly that's probably not enough,"" he said.

But he said it's a balancing act. The city's also paying to fix sidewalks, stairs and bridges.

Setzler tells KDKA that the residents of El Paso Street will see work begin shortly.

""It's very close to the end of the design process and we'll be putting it up to bid for construction, but that was a pretty big landslide, and it took a while to get through the design process,"" he said.",landslide,rain,Morningside,38.82824000000005,-76.88858999999997,1.832,2022-02-16 00:00:00,2022-02-16 23:59:59,12.0,,2022-02-16,11:59:00

A significant rock slide has blocked the popular route.

The U.S. Forest Service announced the trail closure May 14 on its social media platforms. The slide happened about 1 mile from the trailhead, and measures approximately 25 feet wide. The agency did not say how long they expected the path to remain off-limits or when cleanup crews would arrive and begin their work.

Landslides are more likely to happen in an area like this forested canyon, which was damaged in the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire sparked by a Washington teenager who tossed fireworks into the ravine. The U.S. Forest Service says that rockfall and mudslides are likely to continue following heavy rainstorms, and that hikers should stick to trails that are not in recovered burn sites.

""There was a blackout at about 5am, and we could see muddy water flowing on the road in front of our house and down the slope.

""At about 6am, the perimeter wall started to crack and then collapsed along with part of the slope,"" she said.

Dina Liz said the structure of the house had been checked by the developer and was found to be still stable.

""The developer said it would repair the damage and put us up at a nearby homestay,"" she said, adding that the repairs could take about two weeks.

A Fire and Rescue Department spokesman said they received a call about the incident at about 7am.

""Shortly after we arrived, we inspected the location to ensure that no one was hurt.

""We advised the affected house owner and two other residents living near the landslide to vacate their homes for now,"" he said.

Residents' association chairman Datuk Zul Zukree Zakaria said he believed that the landslide was caused by a nearby development project.

""Since the project started about two years ago, there have been numerous flash floods here.

""This time, part of the slope collapsed,"" he said.

""We hope the Ipoh City Council will (view) this matter seriously and take action before more incidents happen,"" he added.

Former lecturer Noah Wong, who has been living in the area for almost a decade, said the roads outside their houses often flooded when it rains heavily.

""It has become worse over the past year and it's just a matter of time before the water enters our houses,"" the 57-year-old said.

Regional Executive Director Gwendolyn Bambalan of the DENR issued the statement after conducting an investigation to determine the cause of a landslide which covers an approximate average width of 90 meters and total height of 1,592 meters above sea level.

The landslide took place at Sitio Diariong, Barangay Villa Gracia, Maddela, Quirino.

“The landslide incident was a natural occurrence due to heavy rains,” stressed director Bambalan.

The investigating team was composed of personnel from the Community Environment and Natural Resources Offices of San Isidro in Isabela and Nagtipunan in Quirino and the local government units of San Agustin and Maddela towns.

Bambalan added that the area is covered with mossy forest and limestone rock formation within the Quirino Protected Landscape.

She also noted that the team discovered bedrocks and boulders along the Sili Creek found at the foot of the incident area, and discolored flowing water from the top of the landslide site.

Bambalan also noted the absence of inhabitants or community in the area and that no traces of illegal activities were found in the site and nearby areas.

The investigators spent almost a week to reach the exact location of the landslide in the mountain.

The agency has yet to ascertain the condition of the uppermost area of the mountain and determine what possibly caused the landslide incident.

The DENR together with the Mines and Geosciences Bureau has scheduled aerial surveillance in coordination with proper authorities to identify what caused the landslide.

The DENR conducted the investigation after a netizen posted on his Facebook account photos of landslide with caption ‘Mahal naming Sierra Madre, bakit may sugat ka, sana’y huwag lumala ang sugat mo. Sanay mapansin natin ito.’

The post went viral in social media with 17,000 reactions when shared by Philippine Weather System/Pacific Storm Update.

About 187 residents had to relocate from the La Baie district after a landslide destroyed a house last week. Dominic Arseneau, a spokesperson for the city of Saguenay, said the city declared a local state of emergency Saturday night and planned to make an official request Monday evening to the province to extend it.

The evacuated area, Arseneau said in an interview, remains unstable and other landslides are “imminent and inevitable.”

“We know it’s going to happen, we just don’t know when,” he added.

Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters Monday she was waiting on the official request from the city before signing the state of emergency order. She said the declaration would allow Saguenay to sidestep the usual paperwork and more easily requisition property, sign contracts and redirect traffic.

“We need a good reason to declare state of emergency, but it’s rare that a municipality will ask for it if they don’t need to,” Guilbault said.

Arseneau said emergency levees have been erected in the affected part of the city to avoid any more displacement and to stop debris and mud from sliding further into the area.

Several groups have offered to shelter displaced families, most of whom had a few hours to pack their belongings and didn’t know whether they would be able to return to their homes.

Marie-Chantale Tremblay says she called her mother, 57, and stepfather, 66, slightly before 10 p.m. on Saturday after seeing on social media that people were evacuating the La Baie neighbourhood.

“My mom didn’t believe it at first, but everything happened so quickly,” Tremblay said Monday in an interview. “We tried to take as much as we could … They left their home, the memories behind.”

Contact Nature, a non-profit that owns two campgrounds in La Baie, is one of the groups that have offered to provide free accommodation to the families affected by the landslides. Its CEO, Marc-André Galbrand, says that five families, including Tremblay’s, have contacted him.

“There are no words; we are devastated like everyone else by what is happening,” Galbrand said in an interview Monday. “We will do everything we can to make the transition as easy as possible.”

Meanwhile, residents were scheduled to meet on Monday with government officials about the different types of assistance programs available to people who are searching for emergency accommodation. Each person who was forced from their home will receive $20 a day for living expenses, the public security department said.

Quebec is also offering $260,000 to those who won’t be able to return to their homes, Guilbault said.

“The city of Saguenay suffered a lot in the past,” she said about the natural disasters that have hit the city. “Right now, people are very proactive because of it, but at one point, people are fed up. We will be there; we know it’s difficult.”

Didier Perret, a research scientist with Natural Resources Canada who has been studying landslides in the Saguenay area since 1996, says the region is known for its unstable clay soil. The city, Perret added, meets a lot of the criteria for landslides.

The affected district is located on a hill with a steep incline, and recent heavy rains have made the soil particularly unstable, he said.

Hundreds of residents of Saint-Jean-Vianney, Que., also in the Saguenay region, were left without homes in May 1971, after a major landslide swept through the community, killing 31 people. In 1996, the Chicoutimi River flooded, triggering landslides and causing damage that killed at least 10 people, forcing thousands from their homes.

“Those events are still remembered,” Perret said. “When landslides happen, it brings back bad memories.”

Alfonzo Caluna Jr., maintenance personnel of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) second engineering district, said he was mowing along the side of the highway in Barangay Poblacion around 8:40 a.m. on Monday when he saw a huge rock falling down the ground.

He quickly ran away and took refuge in a shanty at least 10 meters away, where he parked his motorcycle. “I saw a huge rock falling. It was followed by earth and later trees cascading down the highway,” Caluna said.

The landslide and rockfall blocked all traffic of vehicles entering the town of President Roxas and those going to the town of Antipas during Monday’s rush hour.

To fast track the clearing operation, the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (MDRRMO) in President Roxas used their heavy equipment and cleared the highway in less than an hour.

President Roxas town Mayor Jonathan Mahimpit said small landslides also happened in this particular stretch of highway in the previous week because of the torrential rains brought about by the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and intense thunderstorm.

He appealed to commuters to be vigilant and if possible, avoid passing through these areas during heavy downpour for their safety.

The local government has installed a signage to warn vehicles to be alert against possible rockfall and landslides along this particular stretch of the President Roxas-Antipas highway.

About 14 women were looking for gold grains Thursday in a pit roughly 2 meters (6.5 feet) deep at a small and unauthorized traditional gold mine in a remote village of North Sumatra’s Mandailing Natal district when a landslide plunged down surrounding hills and buried them, said local police chief Marlon Rajagukguk.

A two-hour search and rescue operation managed to rescue two injured women and pulled the bodies of 12 other women from the rubble, Rajagukguk said.

He said authorities have closed illegal gold pits in the area, which was a main source of gold to be panned traditionally by villagers before Thursday’s landslide happened.

Informal mining operations are commonplace in Indonesia, providing a tenuous livelihood to thousands who labor in conditions with a high risk of serious injury or death.

Landslides, flooding and collapses of tunnels are just some of the hazards facing miners. Much of gold ore processing involves highly toxic mercury and cyanide and workers frequently use little or no protection.

The country’s last major mining-related accident occurred in February 2019 when a makeshift wooden structure in an illegal gold mine in North Sulawesi province collapsed due to shifting soil and the large number of mining holes. More than 40 people died, buried in the mine pit.

The county is drawing up a third set of plans to submit to the state Coastal Commission, which rejected previous permit applications in 2012 and again last February. But it’s far from certain those plans will be approved by the commission or what recourse homeowners have if an ocean-generated landslide takes their properties.

The threat of bluff failure is hardly a new problem for these homes above Strands Beach. The first boulder wall was built there in 1969 in preparation for construction of the residential subdivision, known as Niguel Shores, according to Coastal Commission documents.

But the issue is growing more critical there and elsewhere along the California coast, as the commission becomes increasingly adamant about preserving beaches and allowing “coastal migration” to carry the ocean and sands ever farther landward. The likelihood of homes, roads and other structures being lost to the rising sea is expected to become more common, as are tensions over how to address the the conflict.

“The commission is going to be facing harder and harder decisions,” said Sean Hecht, an environmental law professor at UCLA. “It’s really going to be a struggle over time.”

After the Coastal Act took effect in 1977, construction of beachfront armoring needed the blessing of the Coastal Commission, with such approval typically granted only to protect homes built prior to the Coastal Act. But even those seeking to safeguard older properties can find it increasingly difficult to get commission approval.

After a 1977 landslide took out six undeveloped lots in the Niguel Shores community, the commission gave the greenlight to reconstruction of the armoring there. After further damage, the commission approved additional fortification in 1986, although that work was never performed. But when the county returned with a rebuilding request in 2012, it was told to go back to the drawing board and it continues to search for an acceptable proposal nearly a decade later.

In a related case up the coast, at 11 Lagunita Drive in Laguna Beach, the commission in 2018 ordered the removal of a seawall it had approved 13 years earlier. The commission made its decision after determining that a massive remodeling of the home protected by that seawall constituted new development. The homeowner plans to appeal to the state Supreme Court after the commission prevailed in lower courts. If the seawall is removed, at least part of the $25 million home is expected to be taken down as well.

“Many residences and other structures located along the coast were built at a time when current scientific and engineering knowledge were lacking, and folks thought they could build and permit structures up to — and even beyond — the high-tide line without consequence,” said Richard Frank, a UC Davis environmental law professor.

“Now we know that the effects of climate change — especially sea level rise, and more frequent and intense coastal storms — are making many of those structures vulnerable and at risk. In seismically-active coastal areas like Southern California, that risk is exacerbated even more.”

Compounded by the Coastal Commission’s growing desire to retain beaches by allowing them to migrate landward, that situation has raised the stakes of what should be done about it — and Frank points to the Strands Beach dilemma as a prime example of the growing quandary of whether or not to further armor the coast.

Try again

When it rejected the county’s permit application to expand the boulder barrier at Strands Beach in 2012, the commission cited a number of concerns about the revetment, as the structure is known in engineering parlance. Those reservations included the amount of beach that would be lost with the enlarged approach, the durability and longevity of the structure, and mitigation for the environmental damage. One specific suggestion was to include a walkway at the top of the structure to replace public access lost to boulders on the beach.

Working closely with Coastal Commission staff, the county tried to address all of those issues in the application considered by the commission last year, with plan changes including a walkway that would connect with a similar walkway immediately downcoast. That downcoast beachfront structure and path, similar to what the county was proposing below Niguel Shores, were approved by the commission in 2004.

In its report to the commission, staff planners and geologists noted that about 62 homes in Niguel Shores sat on “a massive pre-historic landslide complex.” The report said possible alternatives — including a breakwater and sand replenishment — were investigated, but concluded “the proposed revetment is the least environmentally damaging feasible alternativeto protect the existing endangered structures.”

The commission disagreed, unanimously rejecting the proposal but offering no suggestions for an alternative. Commissioners said they were concerned the structure would result in a loss of public beach to benefit wealthy homeowners at taxpayer expense.

“All of us up here have spoken about the preciousness of our beaches and our terror at their loss,” Commissioner Donne Brownsey said at the Feb. 13 meeting. “(This) is what I consider a handful of homes compared to a large number of people who recreate on that beach and enjoy nature there. The public deserves better.”

An unusual facet of the situation is that the county — not the homeowners, as is usually the case — is responsible for maintaining the bluff, the result of a legal settlement dating to the early days of Niguel Shores development. That issue concerned commissioners, with taxpayers’ price tag for the new structure estimated at $10 million for construction and another $15 million in mitigation fees to be paid to the state.

California Deputy Attorney General Jamee Patterson told the commission last February she would explore other ways to obligate the association to be a signatory to the project. But if she’s made any headway, Patterson isn’t saying so publicly.

“My advice to (the commission) is protected by attorney-client privilege,” she told the Orange County Register this month.

Meanwhile, the county is developing a proposal that “involves only repairing the existing revetment within its previously approved, existing footprint and envelope,” according to county spokeswoman Kristi Bergstrom.

She said the county was monitoring the bluff “to the extent that it relates to the condition of the revetment” and if an immediate threat of significant collapse related to the revetment is detected, the county would apply for an emergency fortification. The commission has approved such emergency permits at San Onofre State Beach and Capistrano Beach in the past four years.

The Surfrider Foundation, which opposed last year’s proposal for the Strands Beach, has called the new plan “an improvement.” And homeowners are largely on board with the county’s approach.

“The Niguel Shores Community Association remains concerned about the deteriorated state of the existing revetment and is supportive of the county’s efforts to come to an agreement with the Coastal Commission,” said association attorney Fred Gaines.

Bergstrom anticipated a commission hearing on the proposed repairs would be held in 6 months to a year. Commission spokesperson Noaki Schwartz said her agency has reviewed the proposal and “didn’t identity any major red flags.”

“However, it still needs to go before the commissioners,” Schwartz said. “This approach is meant to be an interim solution while the agencies work on a longer term response to sea level rise and bluff stability issues.”

Insurance, lawsuits

Some experts say a bluff collapse at places like the Strands Beach may be only a matter of time, one that seawalls and boulders might, at best, forestall.

“You’re buying yourself time with armoring, but many ocean bluffs are eventually not going to hold up,” said UCLA’s Hecht. “When you’re buying above a revetment on an eroding bluff, you’re basically buying for an interim period, over the long term.”

The bluff-front homes in Niguel Shores are valued in the $7 million to $10 million range, according to Zillow.com. Typical homeowners insurance doesn’t cover damage or loss caused by landslides, according to Mark Sektnan of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, an insurance trade group.

For that, you’re going to need landslide insurance, which runs around $4 per $1,000 of coverage — or about $40,000 a year for a $10 million home, according to Money Geek’s extensive online insurance analysis. And if that landslide is caused by a flood or earthquake, you’ll probably need flood or earthquake insurance for reimbursement.

If the homes are damaged or destroyed by a landslide, it’s unclear whether the county or state could be held liable. But Hecht and veteran environmental attorney Mark Massara agreed the Coastal Commission is unlikely to lose such a lawsuit simply because it denied a permit.

Massara pointed to the courts’ support for the Coastal Commission so far in the 11 Lagunita Drive case. And while Hecht said homeowners could claim the failure to grant a permit was a “taking” of property in the event of a landslide, he called the legal strategy “a bit of a longshot.”

“The county is a different issue,” Hecht said. “The settlement is a contractural agreement and the county agreed to maintain the bluff. But then the county could argue its hands were tied by the Coastal Commission. There’s really not a clear answer.”

One thing seems fairly certain: Niguel Shores won’t be the last time you hear about the issue.

Keifang village lies along the 186-kilometre-long main road that connects Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram and Champhai, a town situated near the India-Myanmar border.

Vehicular movement along the road has come to a halt as a result of landslide and rock-fall.

The landslide has also led to disruptions in human movements as well with hundreds of commuters getting stuck at the Aizawl-Champhai road in Mizoram on May 4.

As per reports, efforts are ongoing to clear the road as soon as possible so that the movement of vehicles along this vital route resumes.

Notably, owing to its terrain, landslides happen to be a common phenomenon across the northeastern states with many getting affected every year as a result of it.

Earlier, in an unfortunate incident, three members of a family were buried alive in a heavy landslide in Arunachal Pradesh's Kurung Kumey district near the China border.

As per the reports, the victims were identified as 50-year-old Sariu Tongdang, his wife Sariu Yajik (48), and their eight-year-old son Sariu Takar.

Heavy and incessant rains were creating havoc and fear among the citizens of the state over the past few days.

Heavy and incessant rain on April 17 triggered landslides in different locations, especially in the district headquarters here, disrupting surface communication, water, and electricity supply.

Following the havoc, the district headquarters remained cut off from the rest of the state as the roads were blocked in several places between the old DC office and the mini secretariat in Malapu.

Excavators worked throughout the day Monday to start clearing the spruce trees, mud and boulders that tumbled down the hillside on Saturday, blocking Lowell Point’s only road access to Seward.

The large landslide left stranded tourists with tough choices and forced local Alaskans to figure out how to salvage their weekend getaways as business operators scrambled to accommodate them.

“It’s a massive impact financially,” said Chance Miller, owner of Miller’s Landing in Lowell Point. “And that’s just for right now.”

Listen to this story:

Miller’s business includes a campground, RV park and kayak rentals. And, until the landslide is cleared, there’s no way to get to it except by boat. Miller said his business set up a water taxi system to Seward within a few hours of the slide, which hit around 7:45 p.m. Saturday. It’s charging $25 each way. But, this weekend, it shuttled stranded customers back to Seward for free, eating into its overhead costs.

Seward city officials said it could take at least two weeks to reopen the narrow road to Lowell Point. A contractor for the city started clearing debris on Monday after the city decided there was no immediate risk of another large slide, said Seward City Clerk Brenda Ballou.

Ballou said the excavators worked “gingerly” to remove the 300-foot pile of trees, dirt and boulders from the road, which hugs the side of the mountains next to Resurrection Bay.

“They’re scooping earth, moving it, pushing it off,” she said from the road on Monday afternoon. “They’re trying to create a solid ramp access so that other equipment will be able to get up and they can mitigate some of the debris that’s above them.”

Meantime, about 40 cars are stuck on the other side of the slide in the Lowell Point area. That includes a couple that were part of a planned birthday celebration for 29-year-old Kipp Wilkinson.

After a day of fishing, around 7 p.m. Saturday, Wilkinson drove from Seward to Lowell Point to set up for the party. He made it past the slide area just in time.

“There were a couple boulders there that we drove past and then about 30 minutes later we got a call from our friends and said they weren’t going to make it,” he said.

They made the best of it that night.

“We had such a good time. We had all the beer. We had all the fresh fish. The only thing we didn’t have was tartar sauce,” he said.

Wilkinson said he took a water taxi to Seward on Sunday afternoon and hitched a ride back to Anchorage, where he lives.

Businesses operators, like Lynda Paquette who runs cabins for Angels Rest in Lowell Point, said out-of-state tourists also had to adapt quickly. One visiting family had to figure out a way to catch their flight the next day in Anchorage, said Paquette.

“They have abandoned their rental car here and checked out and then took the water taxi,” she said. Then, they spent hundreds of dollars on a taxi to drive them to Anchorage.

Paquette said some visitors who had stays booked for the next few days or weeks embraced the adventure of an extra water taxi ride. But others weren’t so happy and demanded refunds.

She said the landslide obstacle is another blow for the business after three tough years, beginning with large wildfires in 2019, and then the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I’m feeling more tired than resilient at this point,” she said.

Business owners say landslides are nothing new to the area, but they usually happen after heavy rains. This slide came seemingly without warning, except for a smaller slide that fell earlier in the day Saturday.

Scientists are trying to figure out the cause.

“The current thinking is just that with all the snowfall that we’ve had over the winter, and then over the last few days, the temperatures got very, very warm, and there’s a lot of snowmelt that’s gone on,” said De Anne Stevens, chief of the state’s geological engineering section.

Stevens, who is based in Fairbanks, has been analyzing photos of the slide and talking to scientists on the ground. She said there’s no immediate threat of another large slide.

But, she said, unfortunately for business owners — and recreators — landslides might happen more often in the area in the coming decades due to climate change.

“It’ll probably be a similar situation to what we’re seeing over a lot of parts of Alaska, where landslides are likely to occur, perhaps more frequently, largely, again, due to precipitation and warmer temperatures,” she said.

Brenda Ballou, a spokesperson for the city, told CNN a few hundred people live in Lowell Point, an unincorporated, heavily-visited tourist area on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage.

Marissa Beck, who owns a rental property in Seward, told CNN there are many cabins and rental houses in the area, and guests are now stuck in town or cannot get to their rentals. Many people are taking water taxis or their own boats to get to the other side of the slide.

No one was hurt when the slide occurred, Seward City Manager Janette Bower said in a Facebook post Saturday, and Ballou confirmed.

Nathaniel Caole was headed to walk his dogs on Saturday evening when he noticed a commotion on Lowell Road and pulled off to the side of the road to see what was happening. He noticed a boulder was blocking a part of the road, and cops were stopping traffic from passing by.

Video by Josh Gray.)

Work to clear Lowell Point Road in Seward after a significant landslide Saturday evening hadn’t begun Sunday because of continuing safety concerns, the city reported.

The public is requested to stay clear of the road along Resurrection Bay for their own safety after a slide — estimated at 200-feet high and 300-feet wide — buried the road on Saturday night and has cut off access between Seward and the community of Lowell Point to the south. It is unknown how long the road will remain closed, the city said Sunday.

“It’s not stable still,” said City Clerk Brenda Ballou said. “Until we’re very, very positive that that’s a very stable environment, the work will not begin so the roads are still cut off.”

City officials met with local contractor Metco Alaska on Sunday morning to discuss debris removal, Ballou said. Metco Alaska has begun mobilizing equipment in preparation, but the work cannot begin until the area is safe.

“It may be over 40,000 cubic yards of debris that will have to be removed,” Ballou said.

While enormous boulders have already come down during the landslide, it’s hard to tell if the boulders above are stable or loose, Ballou said.

“It could get more or it could just settle down; We don’t know yet,” she said.

City officials continue to monitor and assess the situation from land and water and using drone footage, the city said in a written update Sunday morning.

After the slide occurred around 7:40 p.m. on Saturday, the City of Seward has declared an emergency, and officials started asking people to stay away from the area.

”We’re all pulling together. There’s no loss of life. And we’re super happy about that,” Seward City Manager Janette Bower said. She noted it could take a week to clear the road.

Seward police in an alert advised vessels in the vicinity of Resurrection Bay that the slide “generated a large floating debris field that includes a number of full sized trees.”

Photos and video of the slide showed a pileup of trees, dirt and debris that broke away from the steep slope above the road and crossed into the water below.

Josh Gray, 33, was driving out Lowell Point Road to camp for the night and meet a group of friends who’d gone halibut fishing earlier in the day.

They were stopped at a small rockslide, and watched with a few other cars as a loader chipped away at the pile. Then, some bigger rocks started tumbling down from the slope.

”Once the trees fell, it was like watching dominoes,” he said. “We’re all looking up at the hillside wondering how high up it’s going to go.”

The Saturday evening response drew Bower, the city police and fire chiefs and Seward’s public works director.

Those officials estimated that there were a couple hundred people — residents and weekend campers — stuck on the far side of the landslide, which cuts off 2 miles of dead-end road.

“Lowell Point has maybe 200-ish residents normally and we have a lot of visitors here though already,” Ballou said. “So it’s really unknown how many additional people might be affected.”

The water taxis are running between Miller’s landing and the Seward Harbor to help visitors and residents, Ballou said.

The taxis can run supplies, and a fire boat can respond to any emergencies, Bower said.

Anyone displaced by the landslide can seek shelter at Seward High School, city officials said. Shelter inquiries can be directed to Jason Bickling at 907-491-0803.

City officials described Lowell Point Road as critical infrastructure, and made note of “city wastewater and electric lines that run the length of that road.”

Gray and the group of friends accompanying him were left searching for a new spot to camp Saturday night. The worst part for them was that the slide left the halibut stuck on one side, and the fixings on the other.

”We’ve got the flour and the butter and the eggs and all the tartar sauce,” Gray said. “The menu’s kind of split.”

Several homes slid down, others were destroyed, and the condominiums below were heavily damaged.

Residents of the Laguna Niguel neighborhood, where ridgetop homes have swimming pools and panoramic views, were sure that no one would ever think of building there again.

Now, 24 years later, a developer is proposing new condominiums at the base of the hill. Improvements made since the landslide will prevent disaster from striking again, the project’s proponents say.

The developer, Barry Hon of Laguna Niguel Properties LLC, is familiar with the risk. He built the original Niguel Summit neighborhood, including the Via Estoril homes, which now sell for more than $1 million, and the condos below.

Residents fear that Hon’s new project will destabilize the hill and send it crashing down again.

“We just don’t want to have to live with that kind of fear and uncertainty and have people move in below us who might also be in danger,” said Sara Nuss-Galles, who has lived on Via Estoril since 2005.

Many also worry that officials will use the increasing demand for housing across Southern California and a requirement that the city zone for more than 1,200 new units as justification to approve the project, when there are safer places in the city to build.

“It is hard to stop development in California,” said Jim Kozel, who lives in Niguel Summit. “It’s our understanding that fighting this is going to be difficult, but we have to protect the homeowners.”

In the 1980s, Hon built about 1,500 homes, including the ones on Via Estoril, on a man-made hill about five miles from the ocean.

Years later, residents on Via Estoril began complaining about cracking walls and sagging fences. At the 41-unit condominium complex below, residents also saw cracks in their walls, and the sidewalks buckled as the earth shifted underneath. Some sued the developer, alleging faulty construction.

Carolyn Brown and her husband, Fred Brown, bought a home on Via Estoril in 1995, drawn to the cool ocean breeze and the view of the Pacific.

A year and a half later, they noticed cracks widening in their driveway and along a retaining wall. Officials determined that the slope was shifting more rapidly after El Niño storms in late 1997.

Officials soon red-tagged several homes on Via Estoril. The structures creaked and glass popped as residents rushed to pack their belongings.

“I remember walking into our bedroom, which was on the back side of the house, and there was this built-in cabinet with drawers, and all the drawers were open,” Carolyn Brown recalled recently. “I looked in the corner of the bedroom. There was a huge gap, and I realized, ‘Oh my God, the house is tilting, and that’s why these drawers have opened up.’ I immediately got out of there and never went back.”

When the hill finally gave way, it sounded like thunder. Two large two-story homes slid down and crumpled into heaps.

The Browns’ home dangled above the hillside for days before disintegrating. In all, nine homes on the ridge were destroyed.

Below, several condominium units were also destroyed, and the entire complex was demolished so the land could be graded to stabilize the area.

The developer and original builder, J.M. Peters, paid millions to the Niguel Summit Community Association as part of a legal settlement. The money was used to build a massive concrete wall with tieback anchors, a giant mass of soil called a buttress, and subdrains to move rainwater.

City officials told residents it was highly unlikely that the land would be built on again.

But the area remained zoned for homes. The city was set to receive a $5.6-million grant to purchase the land and designate it open space, until the Federal Emergency Management Agency pulled back the funding because homeowners had already been paid legal settlements.

Hon and his company are proposing 22 three-story condos on less than two acres at the bottom of the hill along Crown Valley Parkway.

The units are designed to appeal to young people, with floor plans to accommodate working from home and oversized garages that can be used for exercise equipment. Similarly-sized condominiums elsewhere in the city have recently sold for more than $600,000.

“With the city of Laguna Niguel on the edge of a generational shift, the proposed 22 townhomes are responsive to that and seek to attract a younger demographic to the city,” said Marice DePasquale, the community outreach liaison for the project.

DePasquale said the condos, called “The Cove at El Niguel,” will not be built on the landslide footprint and that neighbors’ views will not be affected.

The landslide area “has been stabilized and is suitable to accommodate the plan as currently proposed,” she said.

To provide space for yards and a retaining wall, the construction plan would involve grading the bottom edge of the soil buttress that helps stabilize the hill.

According to geotechnical experts hired by the developer, as well as a separate firm that reviewed the plans for the city, shaving off part of the buttress is safe and won’t affect the stability of the hillside.

The developer has prepared a draft environmental impact report, and the proposal will eventually come before the Laguna Niguel Planning Commission for approval.

It does not need to be approved by the City Council.

Planning Commission Chair Brian Fisk said the proposed condos will take up much less land than the ones that were demolished. He noted that the proposal does not involve building on the hillside.

“We have to rely on our professional consultants that work with the city to address those concerns and then our professional planning staff and the legal team that completes an environmental impact report,” Fisk said. “If we cannot rely on that, then I don’t know what we can rely on.”

Laguna Niguel, like much of Orange County, typically fields proposals for apartments or single family homes. Condominiums are less common, Fisk said.

“We’re looking at whether it’s suitable to have residential there again,” said Fisk, a retired city planner. “This meets the objectives of creating additional housing opportunities in the city, and it’s a for-sale product that we don’t have a lot of.”

As home prices soar amid a longstanding housing shortage, well-heeled suburbs like Laguna Niguel that have room to grow are facing increasing pressure to build.

A state law requires local governments to prepare a plan for new housing every eight years. Cities are assigned a specific number of new units under a complex formula that anticipates future housing needs.

Laguna Niguel’s requirement, approved by the city last year, is to zone for 1,207 new housing units.

Don Ware, who lives up the hill in Niguel Summit and worked for decades as a petroleum geologist, is skeptical that building below the buttress is safe. Even now, he said, the soil has slowly been creeping and settling toward the bottom of the hill.

The proposal includes a wall that would hold back the soil but isn’t intended to stabilize a landslide zone, Ware said.

“I don’t think it’s a good idea to put houses down below a landslide that was repaired with the understanding that there wouldn’t be any houses built there,” Ware said. “So the question for me is always: ‘Well, would you have repaired this slide differently if you knew you were going to do a development down below?’ I haven’t gotten a clear answer.”

Many south and coastal Orange County cities, including Laguna Niguel, have a long history of landslides.

In Laguna Beach, a 1978 landslide destroyed more than 20 homes in Bluebird Canyon. The same area slid again in 2005, destroying 17 homes.

Niguel Summit was built on at least six old landslide areas that were graded and buttressed.

A geological consultant told the developer that stability levels were “generally less than acceptable,” The Times reported in 1998, and that large parts of the parcel were “probably unstable.”

Rebuilding in landslide areas isn’t uncommon but must be done carefully to ensure the land remains stable, said Serge Tomassian, an Irvine attorney who has represented property owners following landslides.

Homebuyers should research landslide risk, but they are often caught unaware, Tomassian said.

Tomassian said cutting into a buttress is risky, and he would be surprised if the city approves such a plan.

Many nearby residents are worried that city officials may put the need for housing above safety concerns.

Nathan Smith bought a house in the Charter Terrace neighborhood, next to the proposed condo development, in 2013. He was attracted to the backyard view of the buttress, which looks more like a lush hillside than a strategy to keep landslides at bay.

Later, it became the first home he shared with his wife and the place where they are raising their two children.

But he is thinking about moving if the condos are approved.

It’s not that he or his neighbors are anti-development, he explained as he looked out over the hillside, still green despite the season’s lackluster rains, in early May.

It’s the fear that what happened 24 years ago could happen again.

“If this was a flat parcel with no tortured history,” he said, “it would be a different story.”",landslide,downpour,Via Estoril,33.51975219289287,-117.72157862924621,0.1445,2021-12-01 00:00:00,2022-02-28 23:59:59,1080.0,,2022-01-14,23:59:00

There were no injuries in the Saturday evening landslide about a half-mile (0.8 kilometer) south of downtown Seward, City Manager Janette Bower said.

A private contractor was handling the removal process and planned to use heavy equipment to clear the debris at the top first, working down to the roadway, Bower said. Part of the work has created additional slides within the original slide, slowing the process.

The slide measured 200 feet (61 meters) long by 300 feet (91 meters) wide and could take up to two weeks to clear, she estimated.

The slide has prevented about 200 residents and tourists from reaching Seward. There is a tiny community south of the slide, called Lowell Point, on the west side of Resurrection Bay, a 17-mile (27-kilometer) long body of water that leads to the Gulf of Alaska.

“There are a lot of cool things going on,” Bower said of efforts to make sure those stranded are able to get back and forth to Seward, including a water taxi and landing crafts. “They’re helping, so a lot of great community coming-together to get things done.”

Before the Seward landslide, traffic was stopped nearby because of falling rocks in the area. A police officer and a city loader were on scene to move rocks, some of which were the size of basketballs before one with a diameter of about 4 feet (1.22 meters) landed near the loader, said Josh Gray, who was with his wife, Nikki Holmes, watching sea lions float in the bay waiting for the all-clear.

They had driven about 125 miles (201 kilometers) south from Anchorage for a birthday party on the other side of the slide. They had just gone to a grocery store for ingredients for the batter to deep fry the fresh halibut their friends had caught earlier in the day. Their friends had made it through the rock fall area 15 minutes earlier.

Gray said all of a sudden, the loader began backing up, and he believes the driver “started to get a sense that things are still pretty active,” he said.

Gray estimated the loader was moving at maybe 4 mph (6 kph) but was able to clear the path “just in time. Things really picked up quickly,” he said just before the slope seemed to collapse before his eyes.

Seward has not had heavy rain recently or other normal conditions that would trigger a landslide, prompting the state geologist to visit the site and assess conditions, Bower said. Torrential downpours in December 2020 triggered landslides in Haines that killed two people.

“You can hear the whooshing of the rocks and earth and then as soon as the trees started falling, then we all knew it was like getting serious,” Gray said.

He looked up the slope and saw the fully grown evergreen trees falling “like dominoes” down the slope and toppling into Resurrection Bay.

“That was pretty alarming,” Gray said.

“My wife was smart to just run back to the car,” he said. “I was dumb enough to be there with phone, videoing it.”

He eventually got in the car and they retreated to the mainland, where they saw the scope of the slide.

“You know, our plans were minorly inconvenienced for the evening, but there’s a lot of residents that live out there and businesses that operate out there that are going to be impacted for a long time, so that’s pretty unfortunate,” he said.

Others also caught the dramatic slide on their phones. Besides posting it widely on social media, they also shared it with city officials.

“We’re really thankful for that video because that was able to confirm that there was no one in the slide,” Bower said.
