One person died and three are missing in northern China after a vehicle fell into the water in mountain flooding from heavy rain in the Inner Mongolia region.

China regularly experiences seasonal rains and flooding during the summer, most frequently in central and southern areas.

Video on state broadcaster CCTV showed large parts of cities flooded in muddy waters. Rescue workers carried trapped people out of buildings on their backs in waist-deep water in Guangdong province, also in the southeast.

The rain ended Wednesday in Jiangxi, but more precipitation is forecast for another week in Fujian, Jiangxi and Guangdong and the nearby Guangxi region. The National Meteorological Center said residents should prepare for floods and landslides as the soil is already saturated in those areas.

More than 110,000 people have been relocated in Jiangxi province, along with more than 80,000 in Fujian, state media reports said.

Seventeen people died last week in rain-related disasters in Guangxi and in Hunan province in central China.

Guwahati:

Fresh landslides were reported from various parts of Guwahati on Wednesday, amid incessant rainfall, which also led to heavy flooding in most parts of the city, officials said.

During the day there were no reports of new casualties.

The state has recorded 42 deaths this year from flooding and landslides, including four that were buried under a massive mound of earth in the Boragaon area on Tuesday.

An official of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) told PTI that accumulation of debris caused by landslides has blocked passageways in the Geetanagar, Sonapur, Kalapahar and Nijarapar areas.

Heavy rainfall has also flooded roads in several parts of the city – the worst affected among them are Anil Nagar, Nabin Nagar, Rajgarh Link Road, Rukminigaon, Hatigaon and Krishna Nagar.

NDRF and SDRF personnel, deployed in these areas, are using boats to rescue people and offer relief supplies to those still trapped in flooded homes, the official said.

Assam Power Distribution Company Limited (APDCL) is working around the clock to restore power in the city, which has been in darkness since Tuesday, while drinking water tankers have been sent to the flooded areas.

The Kamrup Metropolitan district administration has urged people to leave their homes only if they have urgent or essential work.

Kamrup Metropolitan Deputy Commissioner Pallav Gopal Jha has issued an order ordering all schools, colleges and educational institutions to suspend classes in the wake of a rain alert issued by the Regional Meteorological Center (RMC).

The RMC issued a ‘red alert’ for Assam and Meghalaya and forecast isolated and scattered ‘extremely heavy rain’ from Tuesday to Thursday, and ‘orange alert’ for Friday and Saturday.

A bulletin issued by the ASDMA said the flooding situation in several parts of the state is grim, with eight districts being inundated by rising waters in the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries.

Dima Hasao Deputy Commissioner Nazreen Ahmed has issued an advisory asking people to restrict movement in public places.

The consultancy has urged people in vulnerable locations to go to the nearest notified shelters.

Nazreen Ahmed has issued another order ordering all educational institutions to remain closed until May 17, an official release said.

The mighty Brahmaputra flows above the danger sign at Nimaathat in Jorhat district.

According to officials, levees, roads, bridges and other infrastructure have been damaged by flooding in Barpeta, Cachar, Chirang, Dhemaji and Goalpara, among others.

Meanwhile, state congress president Bhupen Boarh led a rally of party members here to protest the state government’s alleged apathy over the situation caused by flash floods in the ‘smart city’.

The protesters, who wade through knee-deep water, were stopped by police from continuing at a distance from the state party headquarters.

The scene that had confronted paramedics was “exceptionally confronting and heartbreaking”, he said, especially as it involved children. The girl had been uninjured but would be assessed again by paramedics and offered pastoral care once she returned to Wentworth Falls.

“This is absolutely heartbreaking for all involved and a truly tragic ending to what I’m sure was meant to be a pleasant day out,” Clarke said.

“It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event.

“This was a really complex and delicate rescue operation for our crews who were working to access patients in rugged bushland and were navigating unstable ground.”

Nelson said the site was incredibly dangerous and unstable after the accident but conditions in general had been favourable for walking on Monday and the track had been open, despite recent flooding in the area.

Experts say extreme weather around the world is being driven by climate change, made worse in South Asia by damming, deforestation and over-the-top development projects.

The Indian Meteorological Department has warned of extreme weather conditions, with a heatwave in northern parts of the country recently triggering water shortages and power cuts.

The department simultaneously warned of heavy rainfall in several other areas, including Assam and other northeastern states, and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala in the south.

A seasonally unusual deluge ahead of the annual monsoon in the northeastern state of Assam has left at least eight people dead and displaced more than 400,000 as of Wednesday.

Four of the victims were killed when their house was buried in a remote village in Dima Hasao district, where landslides undermined railway lines in several areas, making it difficult for authorities to send relief material.

One train was pushed off the tracks by muddy debris from surrounding hills.

The Indian Army, which has been brought in for rescue operations, said in a statement that it had rescued around 300 villagers as of Wednesday.

In Karnataka in southern India, at least two people were found dead late Tuesday, according to media reports.

The landslide in November 2018 created a five-metre waterfall on the river north of Lillooet, and made it nearly impossible for migrating salmon to reach their spawning grounds.

Jeremy Venditti, principal investigator on the project, said his team of scientists will map the topography in the area using a laser to identify between 20 and 100 possible slide sites along the river.

“We’re looking for sites that might be sort of an imminent threat, or where an imminent slide may happen, and then we’ll also be identifying locations where they could happen,” he said in an interview Thursday.

Venditti said his team set up a field site on the same location of the 2018 slide almost a decade before that, so they’ll be able to compare their findings with the 2009 data to see how the slide changed the river and how to better predict these events.

“We felt that, as geoscientists, it was time for us to go and begin investigating where in the Fraser other landslides have happened in the past, but also (where they) will happen in the future, and the effects that they have on flow in the river, fish migration and the genetics of Fraser salmon, which we think have probably been impacted now a number of times by landslides.”

Venditti said they’ll share the information with the Fisheries Department and First Nations communities, so they can prepare for potential slides and make plans to protect the salmon.

He said possible mitigation could include engineering solutions like building fishways that can help salmon get past blocked passages.

The Fisheries Department said that 85,000 cubic metres of rock fell into the river, stopping many salmon runs from migrating.

After the remote slide was discovered, fish were transported past the site using helicopters, trucks and a so-called salmon cannon until a fish ladder was built, although the department said in July that it was still looking for a more permanent solution.

The department has said the slide is a major factor in some of the worst salmon returns on record in the Fraser River.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 12, 2022.

On Monday, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, flew over the affected area of Pernambuco’s capital, Recife, and neighbouring Jaboatao dos Guararapes. Speaking to reporters afterward, he said that landing in the helicopter was not possible due to the soaked soil.

He noted Brazil had recently experienced similar disasters in the mountains above Rio de Janeiro, in southern Bahia state, and in Minas Gerais state.

“Unfortunately, these catastrophes happen in a continent-sized country,” he said. “We’re all obviously sad. We express our sympathy to family members. Our bigger objective is to comfort families and also, with material means, attend to the population.”

The government is moving to make funds available to municipalities that have declared a state of emergency, Daniel Ferreira, the minister of regional development, said at the press conference. He also highlighted a new credit line available to cities afflicted by such disasters.

Experts say climate change contributes to more intense rainfall, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has classified Recife’s metropolitan region as one of the world’s most vulnerable cities. The low-lying metro region is set at the delta of three rivers, features floodplains and a network of dozens of canals and is home to about 4 million people.

""As of 6:00 pm (2100 GMT) this Sunday, the number of people killed as a result of the rains has reached 79,"" the civil defense authority of Pernambuco state, where the affected communities of Recife and Olinda are located, said in a statement.

The disaster is the latest in a recent series of deadly landslides and floods triggered by extreme weather in Brazil.

The number of dead has mounted steadily over the weekend, including dozens in landslides, as heavy rains caused rivers to overflow and torrents of mud swept away everything in their path.

The latest statement from the civil defense did not offer an update on the number of people missing, though the agency had earlier reported 56 people still unaccounted for and nearly 4,000 who had lost their homes.

""We still don't have an exact number, but there are still reports of victims... who have not been found,"" Pernambuco Governor Paulo Camara said during a press conference.

""The search will continue until we can identify all the missing people,"" he said.

Authorities warned that rain was forecast to continue Monday, but in the meantime while the storm subsided some 1,200 personnel -- some in boats or helicopters -- resumed search and rescue work, state officials said.

Minister of Regional Development Daniel Ferreira urged caution in a press conference Sunday in Recife, the capital of hard-hit northeastern Pernambuco state.

""Although it has stopped raining now, we are forecasting heavy rains for the next few days,"" he said.

""So the first thing is to maintain self-protection measures.""

Between Friday night and Saturday morning, rainfall volume reached 70 percent of what was forecast for all of May in some parts of Recife.

'Difficult'

Images circulated on local media showed rescue workers and volunteers clearing heaps of debris in Jardim Monteverde, on the border between Recife and the municipality of Jaboatao dos Guararapes, where 19 died Saturday morning in a landslide that ripped through precariously built homes.

Luiz Estevao Aguiar, who lives in a different municipality, lost 11 relatives in the disaster, he told TV Globo.

""My sister, my brother-in-law, 11 people from my family died. It was difficult... I did not expect this,"" he said tearfully.

Nearby, Flavio Jose da Silva has been desperately looking for his stepfather Gilvan in the rubble of what was once his house.

Shortly after it collapsed, he heard Gilvan say, ""I'm here, under the ground.""

""We hope to find him alive,"" an emotional da Silva said, pointing to a mountain of debris.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Sunday he would travel to Recife on Monday.

Over the past year, hundreds of Brazilians have died in flooding and landslides brought on by torrential downpours.

In February, more than 230 people were killed in the city of Petropolis, the Brazilian then-empire's 19th-century summer capital, in Rio de Janeiro state.

Early last month 14 more were killed by flooding and landslides in the state.

Experts say Brazil's rainy-season downpours are being augmented by La Nina -- the cyclical cooling of the Pacific Ocean -- and by climate change.

Because a hotter atmosphere holds more water, global warming increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.

Risks from heavy rains are augmented by topography and poor construction in shantytowns built in steep areas.

According to meteorologist Estael Sias of the MetSul agency, the heavy rains lashing Pernambuco and, to a lesser extent, four other northeastern states, are the product of a typical seasonal phenomenon called ""eastern waves.""

He explained that those are areas of atmospheric disturbance that move from Africa to Brazil's northeastern coastal region.

""In other areas of the Atlantic this instability forms hurricanes, but in northeastern Brazil it has the potential for a lot of rain and even thunderstorms,"" he said.

NDRRMC Executive Director Ricardo Jalad said in a situational report that 130 deaths were still undergoing verification while seven deaths – six in Western Visayas (region 6) and one in Eastern Visayas – were already confirmed by the national disaster council.

In Leyte province, 128 people were reported dead in Baybay City and in the municipality of Abuyog where rampaging mud and soil buried several residential houses at the height of the storm earlier this week.

Aside from this, six persons in Western Visayas and three others in Davao (Region 11) were previously reported killed by the NDRRMC due to flooding and landslide.

“We are racing against time because the longer it gets, the harder it is for our rescuers to retrieve the victims,” Jalad said during a visit to Barangay Kantagnos, Baybay City on Maundy Thursday.

This will make it hard for authorities to verify the identities of the victims especially in Baybay City where 27 out of the 28 missing persons were reported, Jalad explained.

However, rescuers could not operate in certain areas in Baybay City, such as in Barangay Kantagnos, due to safety issues.

“We have to prioritize the safety of responders. We cannot penetrate the landslide area yet because the soil is still soft. It would be too dangerous for them,” the NDRRMC chief stressed.

Jalad also visited the Abuyog Community College in Abuyog town to personally oversee the situation of the evacuees, and the ongoing response operations and post-disaster activities.

“We have two primary efforts: first is to secure the welfare of evacuees which is being led by the local government units and supported by DSWD and other agencies. Second is the search, rescue and retrieval [operations] undertaken by the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, Philippine Army, Philippine Coast Guard, and response units of LGU),” he said.

Currently, the number of affected persons due to Agaton has ballooned to 494,607 families or 1,689,436 individuals.

The typhoon also displaced a total of 153,694 families or 323,306 individuals, including more than 218,000 who were staying in 1,033 evacuation centers.

The estimated cost of damage to agriculture due to Agaton was pegged at P186,632,976.31 which were incurred in Western Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao (Region 10), Soccsksargen (Region 12), and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

The Foreign Office confirmed it was “providing consular support to the family of a British couple and their children following an incident in Australia” and that it was in contact with local authorities.

New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet called the incident “tragic” and said he would be seeking advice as to whether the walking track should have been open given recent heavy rain.

“These tragedies occur too often so anything we can do to keep people safe, we will,” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

A British lawyer and his nine-year-old son were killed in a landslide while hiking in the Blue Mountains, Australia, media reports said.



Mehraab Nazir, 49, and his family were on a trip to Sydney from their home base in Singapore. They moved from London more than 10 years ago, reports added. The tragic landslide on Monday (4) came after a week of torrential rainfall in the area.

Nazir’s wife Anastasia, 40, 14-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter were rescued from the scene. According to reports, the two teenagers have been reunited with their godmother while their mother remains in a critical condition in hospital.

Reports highlighted that the 15-year-old daughter escaped the landslide physically unscathed and raised the alarm in a frantic call to emergency services at around 1.30pm. Hailed as a ‘hero’, she walked from the scene with the help of emergency crews, which involved trekking for an hour-and-a-half along the hiking track.

After the bodies of Nazir and his son were removed from the area on Tuesday (5), the New South Wales Department of Environment and Heritage announced a “comprehensive review” into what happened would take place.

Nazir was a partner in law firm Watson Farley & Williams. He was specialised in complex cross-border finance transactions with a particular focus on the transportation and energy sectors.

Some of Nazir’s relatives have already arrived in Sydney while others are still making the trip.

The family are part of the Zoroastrian religion, one of the world’s oldest faiths which is based in Iran and follows the teachings of the ancient prophet Zoroaster.

A member of the religious community said they’re mourning such a ‘tragic loss’.

“While we all still come to terms with this immense tragedy, the outpour and generosity of our community is very heart-warming,” said a spokesman from the Australian Zoroastrian Association. “There is much grief among both the London and Sydney Zoroastrian community for this family tragedy.”

British High Commissioner to Australia Vicki Treadell issued a statement early on Wednesday (6) confirming she is assisting the family.

Media reports said that the family were permitted to use the advanced Wentworth Pass track, famous for its stunning waterfall views and valley lookouts, despite weeks of wild weather making the area dangerous for hikers.

Authorities are still working to determine whether the landslide fell on the group while they were walking along a bush track, or if they were trekking along the cliff face that fell.

Their bodies were recovered on 5 April, and the deceased’s 50-year-old wife and another 14-year-old son were critically injured in the incident that happened on 4 April.

The family of 5 was on holiday at the time, and it took more than an hour for rescuers to reach the site, before their bodies were recovered from dense bushland.

Mehraab, a British lawyer who is based in Singapore, was a partner at Watson Farley & Williams Singapore.

His 15-year-old daughter is currently being treated for shock and has been transferred to a children’s hospital in Sydney.

The country's meteorologists forecasted more ""extreme"" rains on the way Tuesday night accompanied by ""widespread flooding"".

""Many people lost their lives with Ethekwini (Durban metro) alone reporting 45 so far,"" while in iLembe district ""more than 14 are reported to have tragically lost their lives,"" the provincial government said in a statement.

It said the disaster ""wreaked untold havoc and unleashed massive damage to lives and infrastructure"" affecting all races and social classes from rural areas, townships to luxury estates.

President Cyril Ramaphosa is due to visit the affected area on Wednesday.

""This is a tragic toll of the force of nature and this situation calls for an effective response by government,"" said Ramaphosa.

Days of driving rain flooded several areas, tore houses apart and ravaged infrastructure across the southeastern city, while landslides forced train services to be suspended.

The rains have flooded city highways to such depths that only the tops of traffic lights poked out, resembling submarine periscopes.

Torrents tore several bridges apart, submerged cars and collapsed houses. A fuel tank was floating in the sea after being tossed off the road.

Several stacked shipping containers fell like dominoes and lay strewn on a yard, while some spilled over into a main road in the city, one of southern Africa's largest regional gateways to the sea.

Global shipping firm Maersk suspended its operations in Durban on Tuesday due to the floods.

""At around 3:00 am (0100 GMT), I felt the truck shaking and I thought maybe someone bumped it and when I tried to open the curtain I saw the water level... was very high,"" said truck driver Mthunzi Ngcobo.

Trapped students and teachers airlifted to safety

The disaster management department in KwaZulu-Natal province, of which Durban is the largest city, urged people to stay at home and ordered those residing in low-lying areas to move to higher ground.

More than 2,000 houses and 4,000 ""informal"" homes, or shacks, have been damaged, provincial premier Sihle Zikalala, told journalists.

Rescue operations, aided by the military, are underway to evacuate people trapped in affected areas.

Fifty-two secondary students and teachers who were marooned at a Durban secondary school, were successfully airlifted to safety following ""a long traumatic night, trapped"", education authorities said.

More than 140 schools have been affected by the flooding.

Durban mayor Mxolisi Kaunda earlier said that power stations had been flooded and water supplies disrupted -- and that even graveyards had not been spared the devastation.

The city had only just recovered from deadly riots last July in which shopping malls were looted and warehouses set on fire, in South Africa's worst unrest since the end of apartheid.

There have been reports of looting, with TV footage showing people stealing from cargo containers.

The provincial government condemned ""reports of the looting of containers"" during the flooding, calling on police to ensure that property was protected.

'Climate change getting worse'

Southern parts of the continent's most industrialised country are bearing the brunt of climate change -- suffering recurrent and worsening torrential rains and flooding.

Floods killed around 70 people in April 2019.

""We know it's climate change getting worse, it's moved from 2017 with extreme storms to supposedly having record floods in 2019, and now 2022 clearly exceeding that,"" University of Johannesburg development studies professor Mary Galvin said.

""Droughts and floods will become more frequent and more intense and that's what we are seeing"" she said, frustrated at government's lack of preparedness.

""It's not surprising, it's absolutely devastating but equally devastating is the fact that we haven't done anything to get ready for it,"" she lamented.

The South African Weather Service admitted that ""the exceptionally heavy rainfall overnight (Monday) and (Tuesday) morning exceeded even the expectations of the southern African meteorological community at large"".

Rio de Janeiro has been hit by inclement weather over the past few weeks. Landslides and flooding in February killed some 240 people in the Petropolis area, in the hills above Rio de Janeiro, authorities said on March 23.

“We have more than 70 homeless families. We are providing shelters and renting hostels for these people,” Luciano Vidal, the mayor of Paraty, told Reuters.

He said mudslides blocked streets and isolated parts of the city, and entire neighborhoods were without electricity in the colonial coastal town that is a tourist attraction.

In one day, Paraty received 322 millimeter (12.68 inches) of rain, the rainfall average for six months. At least seven people died there, Vidal said. The civil defense statement only confirmed five deaths in Paraty.

The town, a tourist destination, declared a state of emergency as more rains were forecast.

In nearby Angra dos Reis, also a tourist destination hit by heavy rainfall, at least sixpeople died, the latest state tally showed.

ST. GEORGE — The Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway, which runs through the heart of Zion National Park, has reopened, following a rockfall described as “significant” by park officials.

Update June 1, 7:40 p.m. Adds re-opening of Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway.

According to a National Park Service news release posted at 7:38 p.m.:

The Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway is open after Zion National Park staff cleared a rockfall west of the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel. After initially clearing the road, National Park Service (NPS) staff observed other loose rocks above the right of way. NPS staff used water pumped from a fire truck to dislodge these rocks.

The rockfall, which occurred west of the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel shortly before 2 p.m., had forced the closure of state Route 9 from the Canyon Junction Bridge to the East Entrance of the park. The length includes much of the area that is usually only accessible to the park’s shuttles as well as the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel.

“There was a rockfall on the highway, Jonathan Shafer, a spokesperson with Zion National Park, told St. George News. “Maintenance crews are going up to address it right now.”

Shafer added that to his understanding, there have been no injuries or property damage connected to the rockslide.

A news release issued by the National Park Service shortly before 4 p.m. Wednesday confirmed the rockfall did not damage any vehicles or cause any injuries. It also did not affect the road to Zion Canyon.

Visitors were still able to access Zion Canyon using the park’s shuttle system, the news release said. Shuttles leave from the park’s South Entrance at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center in Springdale. Visitors traveling from east of Zion were directed to follow alternate routes to arrive at the park’s South Entrance.

The road in Zion is commonly a site that sees landslides from the continually changing landscape of the park, including one last year and another in 2019

The drama took place when heavy rain fell on northern Wyoming and southern Montana on Sunday, causing record-breaking flooding into Monday and Tuesday.

A video shared to social media by Twitter user Anne Leopold showed one SUV approaching a turn on a road while rock slabs fell from the slope above.

Pieces of rock smashed and broke around the SUV, which Ms Leopold said had occupants inside who “seemed okay” despite some rock appearing to strike the vehicle.

Both the SUV and the Twitter user, who was filming the drive out of Yellowstone, had been heading towards the northern gate by Gardiner -- a Montana town badly affected by the water levels.

Only one road out of the tourist town remains open, according to Mike Skelton, the president of the local chamber of commerce.

He told KULR-8 news on Wednesday: “As you know being down here, there were several thousand visitors that were stuck here in Gardiner and couldn’t get out through the park, couldn’t get out through Highway 89”.

Roughly 10,000 people have been evacuated from Yellowstone since Sunday as floodwaters submerged critical bits of infrastructure and popular trails. Only a group of campers remains, officials said.

Residents of neighbouring towns have meanwhile taken-in thousands of visitors and power supplies continue to be affected, as does drinking water. A number of homes and buildings have also been damaged but no fatalities have been reported.

Some 87 people have been rescued by the Montana National Guard following the declaration of a disaster by state governor Greg Gianforte, the agency said on Wednesday.

Water levels in some parts are falling but according to the National Weather Service in Billings, Montana, the flood remains at the highest warning level, of 16ft.

All five park entrances were closed to inbound traffic for the first summer since a series of devastating wildfires in 1988. The National Park Service was working to reach visitors and staff remaining at various locations, especially in the hardest-hit northern flank of Yellowstone, officials said.

“Our first priority has been to evacuate the northern section of the park where we have multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues,” the park superintendent, Cam Sholly, said in a statement.

The “gateway” community of Gardiner, Montana, just north of the park’s northern boundary and home to many Yellowstone staff members, has been cut off due to a mudslide in the vicinity, according to the National Park Service.

Electric power was knocked out in multiple areas of the park, and preliminary assessments showed numerous sections of roads throughout Yellowstone either washed away or covered in rocks and mud, with a number of bridges also damaged, the park service said.

Various roads in the park’s southern tier were on the verge of being flooded, according to the agency.

The flooding and slides were triggered by days of torrential showers in the park and steady rains across much of the wider region after one of its wettest springs in many years. The park service characterized the levels of rainfall and flooding sweeping the park as unprecedented.

A sudden spike in summer temperatures during the past three days also has hastened melting and runoff of snow accumulated in the park’s higher elevations from late-winter storms.

The heavy rains and rapid runoff of snow melt converged to create treacherous conditions in the park just two weeks after the traditional Memorial Day holiday weekend kickoff of the US summer tourist season, which accounts for the bulk of Yellowstone’s annual 4 million visitors.",landslide,continuous_rain,Gardiner,44.22936000000000,-69.77469000000000,6.4325,2022-06-06 00:00:00,2022-06-06 23:59:59,"2022/06/06, 11:59",12.0,

Helena, Mon. (NEXSTAR) —On Monday, a deluge wiped out at least one bridge, washed away roads, and caused a landslide in Yellowstone National Park.

Authorities closed all five entrances, began evacuating visitors from the northern part of the park, and warned that the park was temporarily closed due to a “very dangerous situation.”

Park officials said roads to and from the Gardiner community in Montana, just north of the park, were impassable. Kam Sholy said the loop on the north side of the park could be closed for quite some time.

Park officials planned to evacuate visitors from the park’s South Loop on Monday afternoon. This is because more rain is expected.

Higher levels of flood forecasts prompted the decision, along with concerns about water and wastewater, according to Shory.

The severe weather caused mudslides, with multiple roads being rendered impassible, and a bridge getting destroyed.

""Our first priority has been to evacuate the northern section of the park where we have multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and others issues,"" park superintendent Cam Sholly said in a statement.

Guests already inside the park have been evacuated, and no return date has been announced.

Video footage released the National Parks Service (NPS) shows the northern entrance road to the park from Gardiner, Montana destroyed as water rushes through the canyon.

Communities outside of Yellowstone like Gardiner have been isolated, as roads going in and out of town are rendered impassible.

One family staying in the area in a rental home told CNN they were stranded.

“The water levels were high on Saturday but within the past 10-12 hours things have gotten rougher,” said Parker Manning, who was visiting from Indiana.

Water levels on the Yellowstone River in Corwin Springs, Montana had blown past its previous record high by at least two feet, according to the US Geological Survey. Other rivers in the area were also far above normal levels.

Power is out in some parts of the popular natural park.

It is unclear when the park could re-open.

“We will not know timing of the park’s reopening until flood waters subside and we’re able to assess the damage throughout the park,” Mr Sholly said in the statement. “It is likely that the northern loop will be closed for a substantial amount of time.”

The flooding was caused by intense rainfall, coupled with increased snowmelt. The AP reports that the park saw 2.5 inches of rain fall from Saturday to Monday, with areas nearby recording up to four inches.

In addition, recent warmer temperatures have spurred increased snowmelt in the area, adding even more water to the landscape.

The park is one of the most popular outdoor recreation spots in the US, receiving more than 800,000 visitors a year on average.

The climate crisis is expected to bring significant change to the Yellowstone ecosystem, NPS says. In particular, warmer temperatures will likely bring decreased snowpack and a higher chance of wildfires.

Climate change may also bring more severe storms across the country. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, more rain is now coming during intense rainstorms than in years prior — which could lead to more flash flooding events.

The entire park, spanning parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, will remain closed to visitors, including those with lodging and camping reservations, at least through Wednesday, as officials inspect damage to roads, bridges and other facilities.

The closures come as Yellowstone was gearing up to celebrate its 150th anniversary year, and as local communities heavily dependent on tourism were counting on a rebound following COVID-19 travel restrictions over the past two summers.

All five park entrances were closed to inbound traffic for the first summer since a series of devastating wildfires in 1988. The National Park Service said it was working to evacuate visitors and staff remaining at various locations, especially in the hardest-hit northern flank of Yellowstone.

""It is likely that the northern loop will be closed for a substantial amount of time,"" the park superintendent, Cam Sholly, said in a statement.

The ""gateway"" community of Gardiner, Montana, just beyond the park's northern boundary and home to many of Yellowstone's workers, was cut off by a mudslide to the north and washed-out road surfaces to the south, according to the National Park Service.

Aerial footage released by the Park Service showed large swaths of the winding North Entrance Road between Gardiner and park headquarters in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, carved away by surging floodwaters along the Gardner River - washouts that will likely take months to fully repair.

Power outages were scattered throughout the park, and preliminary assessments showed numerous roadways across Yellowstone either washed away or covered in rocks and mud, with a number of bridges also damaged, the agency said.

Various roads in the park's southern region were on the verge of being flooded, with more rain in the forecast.

The flooding and slides were triggered by days of torrential showers in the park and steady rains across much of the wider Intermountain West following one of the region's wettest springs in many years. The park service characterized the rainfall and floods sweeping the park as unprecedented, with the Yellowstone River topping its banks beyond record levels.

A sudden spike in summer temperatures during the past three days also has hastened melting and runoff of snow accumulated in the park's higher elevations from late-winter storms.

The heavy rains and rapid runoff of snow melt converged to create treacherous conditions in the park just two weeks after the traditional Memorial Day holiday weekend kickoff of the U.S. summer tourist season, which accounts of the bulk of Yellowstone's annual 4 million visitors.

Yellowstone, established as the world's first national park in 1872 and treasured as one of America's top outdoor travel destinations, occupies some 2.2 million acres (890,308 hectares)famed for its geysers, abundant wildlife and spectacular scenery.

Alejando Murat said rivers overflowed their banks and swept away people in homes, while other victims were buried under mud and rocks.

“There were fundamentally two reasons” for the deaths, Murat told local media. “There were rivers that overflowed, and on the other hand, and the most serious part, were landslides.”

Murat said the deaths appeared to be concentrated in a number of small towns in the mountains, just inland from the coast. But he said there were also reports of three children missing near the resort of Huatulco.

Agatha made history as the strongest hurricane ever recorded to come ashore in May during the eastern Pacific hurricane season.

It made landfall on Monday afternoon on a sparsely populated stretch of small beach towns and fishing villages in Oaxaca.

It was a strong Category 2 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 105mph, but it quickly lost power moving inland over the mountainous interior. Remnants of Agatha were moving north-east on Tuesday into Veracruz state.

Murat said power had been restored to some communities near the coast, but that some bridges had been washed out and mudslides blocked a number of highways. San Isidro del Palmar, only a couple miles inland from the coast, was swamped by the Tonameca river that flows through town.

Residents waded through neck-deep water to salvage what items they could from their homes, walking gingerly with piles of clothing atop their heads and religious figures in their arms.

Argeo Aquino, who has lived in the town his whole life, said he could recall only two other occasions when he saw such flooding. “The houses are totally flooded, so they are getting everything out,” Aquino said Monday as he watched his neighbours. “There are stores, houses. More than anything else, we have to try to save all the good material, because everything else is going to be washed away.”

The Tonameca’s brown waters reached the windows of parked cars and the minibuses used for local transportation.

Nearby, heavy rain and high winds lashed the beach town of Zipolite, known for its clothing-optional beach and bohemian vibe. The wind howled for about six hours on Monday, said Silvia Ranfagni, manager of the Casa Kalmar hotel in Zipolite.

“The sound of the wind was really loud, high-pitched,” said Ranfagni. “It started at 1pm when the telephone coverage went out and it didn’t calm down until 7.30.

The water started to slowly recede Tuesday and one key highway reopened, but the record-level floods left all five entrances to the park closed through at least Wednesday, officials said. And, officials said during an update on Tuesday, the water levels could still change at any time.

“The water is still raging,” said Park Superintendent Cam Sholly, who added that more wet weather was forecast this weekend, which could cause additional flooding.

The park, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, has seen multiple road and bridge failures, power outages and mudslides, causing the evacuations of more than 10,000 visitors from the park.

“I’ve never seen this, not in my lifetime,” said Austin King, a firefighter and EMT in Gardiner, a town just outside Yellowstone's busy northern entrance.

There were no reports of injuries or deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, but floodwaters swept away a number of homes, bridges and other structures. The northern part of the park suffered the worst damage.

The full scope of the damage was not known Tuesday, leaving it unclear when roads might reopen or when residents in neighboring communities might be able to return.

The northern loop of Yellowstone National Park was cleared of visitors and park officials were working to evacuate visitors in the southern area of the park Tuesday. Park staff were searching for five back-country groups to ensure they were safely evacuated.

Meanwhile, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte declared a statewide disaster and said the Montana National Guard rescued 12 people stranded by high waters in Roscoe and Cooke City.

Highways reopen as floodwaters recede

The Yellowstone River reached highs of almost 14 feet on Monday, far higher than the record 11.5 feet set more than a century ago, according the the National Weather Service.

Although the water was still ""extremely"" high, a route out of Gardiner, a town of about 900 people, reopened Tuesday afternoon, according to county Commissioner Bill Berg and Sholly.

Visitors could drive out using U.S. Highway 89 and East River Road, but only residents and service vehicles were allowed to drive back inside. While some residents questioned if they could wait a few days before leaving town, Berg and Sholly were adamant: “Get out of Gardiner.”

""We are working with the county and state of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas,"" Yellowstone officials said Monday.

A smaller highway into the previously isolated Cooke City also reopened to local traffic and emergency services Tuesday afternoon.

Yellowstone communities left stranded, without power

The flooding left some of Yellowstone's small gateway communities in southern Montana isolated and without power, leading to evacuations by boat and helicopter.

Floodwaters isolated areas including Silvergate, which is east of the park, and led to evacuations in Livingston. As Stillwater River in south-central Montana flooded, 68 people were stranded at a campground as crews rescued campers by raft.

Officials in Park County, which encompasses those cities, issued shelter-in-place orders Monday and warned flooding had made drinking water unsafe in many communities. Residents hauled bottled water home from stores and worried about a possible food shortage.

Many in Gardiner have used only bottled water to brush their teeth, wash dishes and prepare food due to a break in the area's main water service line. The community was under an advisory to boil water before consumption as of Tuesday afternoon.

The county said water and air rescues were underway amid evacuations Monday.

""Extensive flooding throughout Park County has washed out bridges, roads, and left communities and homes isolated,"" Park County said in a statement.

A 10-person bunker was among the buildings that slipped from the riverbank into the water. Only a portion of the building's foundation remained Tuesday.

Parker Manning, who was visiting from Terre Haute, Indiana, watched the flooding from a cabin in Gardiner. He said he saw trees and a mostly intact house floating in rushing waters.

In the south-central Montana town of Joliet, Kristan Apodaca cried as she watched floodwaters overtake her grandmother's log cabin and the park where her husband proposed.

""I am sixth-generation,"" she told the Billings Gazette. ""This is our home.""

King, the EMT in Gardiner, said the flooding was ""damaging for a lot of people.""

""Some have lost their houses; others can’t go to work,"" King said. ""People are worried about food shortages already.""

When will Yellowstone reopen?

Yellowstone officials have prohibited visitors from entering the park at any of its five entrances until at least Wednesday.

Sholly said the park could remain closed as long as a week, and northern entrances may not reopen at all this summer.

Cory Mottice, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Billings, Montana, said reduced rain and cooler temperatures, which could lead to decreased snowmelt, may lessen flooding.

Still, ""this is flooding that we’ve just never seen in our lifetimes before,"" Mottice said.

Why is Yellowstone flooding?

Record rainfall combined with rapidly melting snowpack caused the deluge of flooding this week. Scientists pointed to climate change as the culprit behind more intense and frequent weather events.

The flooding happened as the summer tourist season was ramping up. June is one of the park's busiest months.

What state is Yellowstone National Park in?

The world's first national park, Yellowstone National Park encompasses nearly 3,500 square miles on top of a volcanic hot spot. The park lies mostly in Wyoming but spreads into Montana and Idaho.

The park allows visitors ""to observe wildlife in an intact ecosystem, explore geothermal areas that contain about half the world’s active geysers, and view geologic wonders like the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River,"" according to the Yellowstone's website.

All entrances to Yellowstone National Park were closed Monday and would be through at least Wednesday as heavy rain falling on melting snow caused significant flooding and road damage, park officials announced.

Calling it “extremely hazardous conditions,” authorities evacuated the northern portion of the park due to flooding, rockslides and mudslides caused by record rainfall.

Park officials announced on Monday afternoon that the park would be closed to visitors until at least Wednesday.

“Red Lodge, Montana, is a river right now and we have some flooding on the west of Cody,” Cody Beers, a Wyoming Department of Transportation spokesman, told Cowboy State Daily. “I’ve never heard of Yellowstone closing the entire park to inbound traffic, though.”

Footage from the storms showed roads collapsing into raging rivers and logs piled high on the shores.

The electricity was out in several areas of the park as of Monday morning.

All inbound traffic to the park was halted until conditions stabilized and park officials could assess damage to the roads, bridges and other facilities. The visitors turned away included those with lodging and camping reservations.

Many of the park roads could be closed for an extended period of time, according to park officials.

“It’s just been multiple days of rain up in this area, plus we had snow on Memorial Day weekend,” Beers said. “It’s a rare day when we have water levels that reached the bottom of our bridges.”

Cowboy State Daily meteorologist Don Day said flood advisories surround Yellowstone because of the “huge amount of snow” coupled with the significant rain.

“I don’t think anyone thought the runoff would be as big as this,” he said.

Beers said WYDOT will continue to monitor the weather events in the northwestern portion of the state and how they might affect roads.

He recommended anyone traveling toward Yellowstone wait a day or two for officials to figure out how long certain roads will be closed and whether the rainfall in the area will continue.

“Be careful out there, because Mother Nature’s fury is showing itself right now,” Beers said.

Yellowstone superintendent Cam Sholly said on Monday that staff’s first priority was to evacuate the northern section of the park, where there were multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues.

“The community of Gardiner is currently isolated, and we are working with the county and State of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas,” Sholly said. “Due to predictions of higher flood levels in areas of the park’s southern loop, in addition to concerns with water and wastewater systems, we will begin to move visitors in the southern loop out of the park later today in coordination with our in-park business partners.”

Sholly said it was likely the northern loop of the park would be closed for a substantial amount of time.

“I appreciate the efforts of the Yellowstone team and partners to safely evacuate areas of the park and of our gateway community partners who are helping us through this major event,” he said. “We appreciate the support offered by the Department of Interior, National Park Service and the Montana and Wyoming governors.”

Alana Davis was recording footage on TikTok from a beach along the Douglas Highway on April 6 when the rockslide happened.

Video shows her interrupted mid-sentence by a crashing noise. She immediately grabs her camera and runs for safety, waving her arms and shouting at highway traffic to stop.

“Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop your car!” she yelled while trying to catch her breath.

Davis said a man driving a pickup was about to encounter a blind turn on the highway while traveling at 50 mph.

“Literally 30 seconds from getting killed. Think about that,” the man told Davis.

“I ran screaming down the road, just so you know, on the beach flailing my arms,” she replied.

Landslide and debris flow warning signs include a faint rumbling sound that increases in volume and is noticeable as the landslide nears, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Unusual sounds, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together, might indicate moving debris.

Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities spokesman Sam Dapcevich said about 500 cubic yards of material fell to the road from a cliff about 500 feet up the hillside near mile 11 of North Douglas Highway on April 6. Crews immediately responded and cleaned up the slide debris to reopen the highway.

On April 10, a second slide took place at the same location with approximately twice the quantity of material reaching the road, including several car-sized boulders that bounced across the road and over the guardrail, finally landing on the beach or in the water.

“Our maintenance and operations foreman was there working on cleanup when the second slide came down, and he took action to keep traffic from passing through,” Dapcevich said.

As of Wednesday, both lanes are cleared, but the road will remain closed while geologists monitor the site. A geotechnical team is gathering imagery with a drone as weather conditions allow.

“It was very windy during both slide events, many tree roots are now exposed that appear to have grown in the rock crevices. The wind moving the trees likely jostled the rock and could have been the cause of both slides. There’s still a lot of rock up there that could come down in the future,” Dapcevich said.

ST. GEORGE — A significant rock slide occurred in Zion National Park on Tuesday morning around 9 a.m. and covered part of a road.

Zion Canyon Scenic Drive, north of the Grotto, was blocked and shuttle buses could not pass the slide, said Jonathan Shafer, Zion National Park public affairs specialist.

Within 30 minutes, however, the Zion Canyon Scenic Scenic Drive north of the Grotto was reopened and remains open. The rocks have been cleared and buses are running again. Shafer cautioned that pedestrians should avoid the area today.

One of the larger rock slides in Zion National Park occurred in August 2019 bove the Weeping Rock shuttle stop in the main canyon. According to St. George News, the immense rockslide injured three people, and several others were temporarily stranded.

Villages around Baybay city in the central Leyte province were badly hit, with hillside avalanches and overflowing rivers.

In one village, Pilar, about 80% of the houses were washed out to sea.

The agency also reported deaths in the southern Davao region, Mindanao and in the central Negros Orientals province.

Many people fled their homes to shelters or higher ground when the storm, known locally as Agaton, hit the archipelago with winds of up to 65km/h (40mph).

Pictures posted by the Philippines Coast Guard show rescuers carrying the injured on stretchers through chest-high water and ferrying survivors on rafts down flooded streets.

The rescue effort was hampered by rain although conditions eased on Tuesday.

It was the first such storm of the year – the Philippines typically sees an average of 20 each year.

It comes about four months after Super Typhoon Rai devastated many of the nation’s south-east islands in December – killing at least 375 people and affecting about 500,000 people.

It was the worst storm to hit the Philippines that year and experts said it had grown stronger far quicker than anticipated.

Marissa Miguel Cano, a public information officer in Baybay, told AFP news agency: “It’s supposed to be the dry season but maybe climate change has upended that.”

“I gathered my children in our house in Brgy. Maypatag (Ambuhan) from our other house in the barrio in preparation for my birthday. I was supposed to slaughter a pig for the celebration. We were happy before this happened,” recalled Mejia.

He said they were awakened by a loud rumbling noise around 3 a.m. on Monday (April 11) in what turned out to be an experience so tragic and so painful.

“When my wife and son got up, we were blown away by the mud coming from the mountain,” he recalled.

One of his sons was saved when he covered himself under their refrigerator that leaned to the wall.

“I heard my children crying for help. I told my son to call for help while I dug through the mud to save them,” he narrated.

He said that because of the landslide, it took time before the villagers came to help him rescue his children.

“At first I could hear one of them calling for help (Tabang) for about 20 minutes. I tried digging with my bare hands with no light until her voice stopped, then another one cried for help,” he narrated.

Remigio was able to save one of them. However, his 16-year-old daughter and 8-year-old granddaughter were already dead when they found them. That broke his heart.

He said the village chief of Brgy. Imelda was kind enough to allow them to have the vigil in the Brgy. Hall, and let them sleep there together with the families of the other victims.

Meanwhile, Mantesa Polvera and her sister Karen Joy, who both came home from Luzon could also not believe that their whole family was buried alive in the landslide in Brgy. Mailhi.

While they were attending the wake of their mother, three siblings, and two nieces, they found out that their father’s body has been recovered from the rubble.

Their uncle and one other relative remain missing.

Aside from grieving the loss of their loved ones, Mantesa and her siblings are having trouble finding the money for the burial of their family members who perished.

They were grateful for Bernandino Tacoy of BGT Cares Foundation who arrived from a relief operation to the evacuees and extended burial assistance to them.

Scores of people are still missing and feared dead after the strongest storm to strike the archipelago nation this year dumped heavy rain over several days, forcing tens of thousands into evacuation centres.

In the central province of Leyte — the worst affected by Agaton— devastating landslides smashed farming and fishing communities, wiping out houses and transforming the landscape.

The disaster-prone region is regularly ravaged by storms — including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013 — with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of climate change.

Emergency personnel in Abuyog have retrieved dozens of bodies from the coastal village of Pilar, which was destroyed by a landslide on Tuesday.

At least 42 people died in landslides that hit three villages in the municipality, police said. Another person drowned.

Most of those deaths were in Pilar, with at least 28 bodies brought by boat to a sandy lot near the municipal government building after roads leading to the settlement were cut off by landslides.

More than 100 remained missing, and Abuyog Mayor Lemuel Traya told AFP there was little hope of finding anyone else alive.

An aerial photo showed a wide stretch of mud and earth that had swept down a mountain to the sea, crushing everything in its path.

The wreckage of houses and debris was scattered along the shore.

Bad weather and thick mud had complicated retrieval efforts in Pilar, where the ground was unstable. Searchers were also combing the coastline after some bodies were swept kilometres away by ocean currents.

“This will not end soon, it could go on for days,” Traya warned.

Many of those who died had hiked to higher ground to avoid flash floods, villagers told AFP.

“It sounded like a helicopter,” said Pilar councillor Anacleta Canuto, 44, describing the noise made by the landslide.

Canuto, her husband and their two children survived, but they lost at least nine relatives.

Pilar fisherman Santiago Dahonog, 38, said he rushed into the sea with two siblings and a nephew as the landslide hurtled towards them.

“We got out of the house, ran to the water and started swimming,” he told AFP. “I was the only survivor.”

Scores missing in Baybay

Another 101 people were killed and dozens injured in vegetable, rice and coconut-growing villages around Baybay City at the weekend, local authorities said. At least 103 are still missing.

The hardest hit was Kantagnos, where 42 people died and 93 have not been found.

In the nearby village of Bunga, 17 people perished when sodden soil shot down a hill and slammed into the riverside community. Only a few rooftops are visible in the mud, which has started to smell of rotting flesh.

Three people also drowned on the main southern island of Mindanao, and one person died in the central province of Iloilo, the national disaster agency said in its latest update.

Another three deaths previously reported in the central province of Negros Oriental were dropped from the tally after they were found to be unrelated to the storm.

“Agaton” struck at the beginning of Holy Week, one of the most important holidays in the mainly Catholic nation, when thousands travel to visit relatives.

It came four months after a super typhoon devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The death toll from landslides and floods that hit the central and southern Philippines after a summer tropical depression unleashed days of pounding rain has risen to at least 43, with 28 others missing, officials said Tuesday.

More than 100 villagers were injured in landslides in the hard-hit city of Baybay in central Leyte province over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing villagers.

“We are saddened by this dreadful incident that caused an unfortunate loss of lives and destruction of properties,” said army brigade commander Col. Noel Vestuir, who was helping oversee the search and rescue.

Thirty-six of the dead were recovered from the landslides that hit six Baybay villages, military and local officials said. Seven other people drowned in floodwaters in the central provinces of Samar and Negros Oriental and southern Davao de Oro and Davao Oriental provinces.

More rescuers and heavy equipment, including backhoes, arrived in the landslide-hit villages in Baybay, but continuing rain and muddy ground have hampered the efforts. “The challenge is, it’s continuing to rain and we cannot immediately clear the landslide areas,” Vestuir said.

Coast guard, police and firefighters rescued some villagers Monday in flooded central communities, including some who were trapped on their roofs. In central Cebu city, schools and work were suspended Monday and Mayor Michael Rama declared a state of calamity to allow the rapid release of emergency funds.

At least 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year, mostly during the rainy season that begins around June. Some storms have hit even during the scorching summer months in recent years.

The death toll from landslides and flooding in the Philippines triggered by Tropical Storm Megi has risen to at least 115, as search teams found more bodies in mud-buried villages.

Eighty-six of the casualties were in Baybay, a mountainous area prone to landslides in central Leyte province, where 236 people were also injured, the city government said in a report.

Megi was the first tropical storm this year to hit the Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands.

Dozens of people are still missing and feared dead after several days of torrential rain with tens of thousands of people forced into evacuation centres.

“The search, rescue and retrieval operations will continue,” a Philippine Army infantry unit in Baybay said on Facebook.

Aerial photographs and video from the local government showed collapsed slopes, burying coconut plantations and houses in dirt and mud. In one area, rescuers had to use rubber boats to reach a landslide.

Megi made landfall on Sunday with sustained winds of up to 65 kilometres (40 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 80 kph (49 mph), but has since dissipated.

Dozens remain missing and almost 200 people were injured in the city of Baybay and across Leyte province, officials said.

Efforts were continuing to remove large chunks of earth to find the people under the rubble. The clearer weather on Wednesday allowed the work to expand as heavy equipment arrived in Baybay.

“We’re looking for so many more missing people,” Baybay mayor Jose Carlos Cari said.

Rescuers have been using their bare hands and shovels to reach victims buried by the landslides.

A Philippine Coastguard video shared on Facebook on Tuesday showed rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher from one of the devastated villages, while other victims were piggybacked to safety.

The military has joined coastguard, police and fire protection personnel in the search and rescue efforts, which have been hampered by bad weather.

Tropical storm Megi hit the central province of Leyte before a series of landslides ensued, smashing into farming settlements and devastating entire communities.

Megi came shortly after another tropical storm Agaton hit parts of the archipelago and four months after super typhoon Rai devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Scientists have long given warnings that typhoons are strengthening as the planet becomes warmer due to climate change.

The death toll from landslides and floods in the Philippines has risen to 67 with scores missing and feared dead, officials said, as rescuers dug up more bodies with bare hands and backhoes in crushed villages.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi – the strongest to hit the Southeast Asian archipelago this year – were in the central province of Leyte.

Thirteen people died and around 150 were missing in the coastal village of Pilar, which is part of Abuyog municipality, after a torrent of mud and earth pushed houses into the sea and buried most of the settlement, Abuyog Mayor Lemuel Traya said.

“I have to be honest, we are no longer expecting survivors,” Traya told AFP, adding that emergency personnel were now focused on the difficult task of retrieving bodies.

About 250 people were in evacuation centres after being rescued by boat after roads were cut by landslides, he said.

A number of villagers were also in hospital.

A rumbling sound like “a helicopter” alerted Ara Mae Canuto, 22, to the landslide hurtling towards her family’s home in Pilar.

She said she tried to outrun it, but was swept into the water and nearly drowned.

“I swallowed dirt, and my ears and nose are full of mud,” Canuto told AFP by telephone from her hospital bed. Her father died and her mother has not been found.

Disaster-prone Philippines is regularly ravaged by storms – including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 – with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of human-driven climate change.

Baybay City is also reeling after waves of sodden soil smashed into farming settlements over the weekend, killing at least 48 people and injuring over 100, local authorities said. Twenty-seven are still missing, they added.

Aerial photos showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga village, where only a few rooftops poked through the now-transformed landscape.

“We were told to be on alert because a storm was coming, but they did not directly tell us we needed to evacuate,” said Bunga farmworker Loderica Portarcos, 47, who lost 17 relatives and a friend in the landslide.

Portarcos braved heat and humidity as she advised a backhoe operator where to dig for three bodies still embedded in the soft soil which had started to smell of rotting flesh.

“Our dead relatives are all in the morgue, but there will be no time for a wake to mourn them because the mayor told us they smell bad,” she said.

‘Many of us died’

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

The death toll from Megi is expected to rise as rescue operations switch to recovering bodies.

Abuyog police chief Captain James Mark Ruiz said more boats were needed for victims in Pilar. But getting access to the shore was difficult.

Photos posted by the Bureau of Fire Protection on Facebook showed buildings crushed or turned over by the force of the landslide and debris in the water.

“We’re using fiber glass boats and there are steel bars exposed in the sea so it’s very difficult,” Abuyog Mayor Traya said, adding that the ground was unstable and “very risky”.

While Pilar survivor Canuto counts herself lucky to be alive, she said “many of us died and a lot are missing too”.

Whipping up seas, Megi forced dozens of ports to temporarily suspend operations, stranding thousands of people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year in the Philippines.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi — the strongest to hit the disaster-prone archipelago this year — were in the central province of Leyte, where a series of landslides devastated communities.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Search operations for survivors in Pilar village — part of Abuyog municipality in Leyte — resumed at first light on Wednesday, with boats carrying rescuers to the coastal community of around 400 people.

The operation came a day after a landslide pushed many houses in the village into the sea.

“We have five casualties, one unidentified,” Captain James Mark Ruiz of Abuyog police told AFP.

Ruiz said more boats were needed to rescue victims and retrieve bodies in the ongoing search after landslides cut off road access to the community.

Around 50 survivors have been ferried from the village, the Bureau of Fire Protection said on Facebook on Tuesday.

Photos posted by the agency showed buildings crushed or turned over by the force of the landslide and debris in the water.

Medical workers rushed to treat victims as they were brought to shore, applying bandages to cuts and providing emergency blankets. One woman had her right arm in a splint.

Raymark Lasco, a radio operator at the Abuyog disaster agency, told AFP that “many people” had died and that rescue operations were ongoing.

Port operations suspended

Search operations also resumed around Baybay City after the rain stopped, enabling emergency personnel to access hard-hit areas, Mayor Jose Carlos Cari told CNN Philippines.

“In some barangays (villages), we’re just doing retrieval,” Cari said.

Rescuers have been using their bare hands and shovels to reach victims buried by the landslides.

In Abuyog, 32 persons, 29 of whom were residents of Barangay Pilar, had been retrieved.

The number of fatalities in the two landslide-hit areas was expected to increase as retrieval operations continued.

Anamelle Bantaculo, village councilor of Kantagnos, one of the worst-hit areas in Baybay, appealed for help, especially food, water, medicine, blanket, and even tarpaulin for residents, who survived the mudslide but lost their homes.

“Our gymnasium is now occupied by 65 families. I’m asking people to help us even by providing tents for affected families, especially those who lost their homes,” she said.

In Abuyog, about 43 kilometers away from Baybay City, 32 people died due to a landslide.

Fr. Amadeo Alvero of the Palo Archdiocese and part of the Caritas in Palo said he did not expect the tragedy to happen.

“I talked to some survivors who thought they could not survive. Indeed most of them were still shocked. Many of them shared that they made a great run for them to survive. And they prayed hard, calling God to spare their lives,” he said.

“Many are still waiting for the missing members of their families as the rescuers continue to retrieve bodies from the rubbles,” he added.

Residents believed 177 persons were missing from Pilar, a village located at the foot of a mountain where the landslide originated.

On Wednesday, Social Welfare Secretary Rolando Joselito Bautista visited Baybay City and went to the villages of Bunga and Katagnos where he extended financial assistance to affected families.

As search and rescue efforts increased with the arrival of equipment, the death toll has risen to at least 56, with 28 others missing, after a summer tropical depression that unleashed days of pounding rain caused landslides and floods in the central and southern Philippines, officials said Wednesday.

Nearly 200 villagers were injured mostly in the landslides in the hard-hit city of Baybay in central Leyte province over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing villagers.

More rescuers and heavy equipment, including backhoes, arrived in the landslide-hit villages in Baybay. Its mayor, Jose Carlos Cari, said the weather cleared Wednesday, allowing the search and rescue work to go full force.

""We're looking for so many more missing people,"" Cari said and added that authorities would do a recount to determine how many villagers were really missing and believed buried in the landslides.

Forty-seven of the dead were recovered from the landslides that hit six Baybay villages, military and local officials said. Nine other people drowned elsewhere in floodwaters in four central and southern provinces, they said.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Three Uruguayan tourists died in the southern Argentine city of San Carlos de Bariloche when a torrent of mud and other debris filled their hotel rooms. Rescue workers on Wednesday located the bodies of two tourists who had been missing in the Bustillo Hotel, according to the public prosecutor’s office of the province of Rio Negro, where San Carlos de Bariloche is located.

The other person who was killed had been found hours after the mudslide that caused tons of mud to rush into the hotel on Monday afternoon following a big rainstorm. Three others were injured and remain hospitalized.

The two bodies located early Wednesday morning were on the bed in a hotel room that had been covered to the roof with mud and other debris.

“Half of the mud was removed before we could reach the people who were in the bedroom, lying down on the bed,” Patricia Díaz, subsecretary of Bariloche Civil Protection, said.

The Patagonian city of Bariloche, located some 1,500 kilometers south of Buenos Aires, is one of Argentina’s main tourist destinations.

Officials have yet to release the names of the victims.

The local prosecutor’s office is investigating the cause of the mudslide and officials will be meeting with family members of the victims and Uruguayan diplomats.

At least 21 people were dead after landslides slammed into several villages in Leyte province -- one of the hardest hit by the storm -- local authorities said.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Photos showed the rooftops of several homes in Bunga, one of the Leyte communities affected, poking above a river of mud.

Rescue efforts were focused on the nearby village of Kantagnos, which an official said had been hit by two landslides.

Some residents managed to escape or were pulled out of the mud alive, but many are still feared trapped.

Five people have been confirmed dead in Kantagnos, but it is not clear how many are still missing.

A Philippine Coast Guard video shared on Facebook showed six rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher to safety.

“There was a small landslide and some people were able to run to safety, and then a big one followed which covered the entire village,” Jose Carlos Cari, mayor of Leyte’s Baybay City, told local broadcaster DZMM Teleradyo.

“We’re looking for many people, there are 210 households there.”

Cari said the bad weather was hampering rescue efforts.

“We’re pushing, but we’re having a hard time because it’s dangerous,” he said.

“Equipment has been mobilised, everything is ready, but we’re unable to move because it’s still raining heavily and rivers are still swollen.”

The military has joined coast guard, police and fire protection officers in the search and rescue efforts.

National disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal said landslides around Baybay City had reached settlements “outside the danger zone”, catching many people by surprise.

“There were people in their homes that were hit directly by the landslide,” Timbal told AFP.

Tropical storm Megi -- known in the Philippines by its local name Agaton -- is the first major storm to hit the country this year.

Whipping up seas, it forced dozens of ports to suspend operations and stranded nearly 8,000 people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year.

The Philippines re-opened to fully vaccinated tourists from most countries in February after lifting practically all Covid-19 restrictions, and Easter is a popular holiday for domestic tourists.

The storm comes four months after a super typhoon devastated swathes of the archipelago nation, killing more than 400 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Scientists have long warned typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer due to climate change.

The Philippines -- ranked among the most vulnerable nations to its impacts -- is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

More than 17,000 people fled their homes as the storm pummeled the disaster-prone region in recent days, flooding houses, severing roads and knocking out power.

At least 36 people died and 26 were missing after landslides slammed into multiple villages around Baybay City in Leyte province – the hardest hit by the storm – local authorities said. Just over 100 people were injured.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Most of the deaths in Leyte were in the mountainous village of Mailhi where 14 bodies were found, Army Captain Kaharudin Cadil told AFP.

“It was a mudflash that buried houses. We recovered most of the bodies embedded in the mud,” said Cadil, spokesman for the 802nd Infantry Brigade.

Drone footage showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga, another community devastated by the storm.

At least seven people had been killed and 20 villagers were missing in Bunga, which was reduced to a few rooftops poking through the mud.

“It’s supposed to be the dry season but maybe climate change has upended that,” said Marissa Miguel Cano, public information officer for Baybay City, where 10 villages have been affected by landslides.

Cano said the hilly region of corn, rice and coconut farms was prone to landslides, but they were usually small and not fatal.

Rain showers began Thursday, leading to deadly landslides in the region. The volume of rain registered in the last 48 hours was the highest on record in Angra dos Reis, according to the city's municipal government.

Officials told affiliate CNN Brazil on Saturday that a landslide in the town of Paraty killed at least eight people -- a father and seven of his children -- ages 2 to 17. A seventh child was rescued and transported to a hospital, municipal officials told the affiliate.

At least four other people were injured -- none seriously -- after seven houses were hit by landslides in the coastal community of Ponta Negra, according to officials in Paraty. More than 22 neighborhoods sustained flooding and 71 families were displaced.

In the municipality of Mesquita, a 38-year-old man was electrocuted to death after three days of heavy rainfall, CNN Brazil reported.

Torrential rains have triggered flash floods and landslides across Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state, killing at least eight people including six children and leaving 13 missing, authorities said on Saturday.

Two days of heavy rain have battered a broad swath of the southeastern state’s Atlantic coast, the latest in a series of deadly storms in Brazil that experts have said are being aggravated by climate change.

The latest floods and landslides come six weeks after flash floods and landslides killed 233 people in the scenic city of Petropolis, the Brazilian empire’s 19th-century summer capital, also in Rio state.

This time, the areas hit hardest included the tourist town of Paraty, a seaside colonial city known for its picturesque cobblestone streets and colourful houses.

Officials on Saturday there said a landslide in the Ponta Negra neighbourhood had killed a mother and five of her children, ages two, five, eight, 10 and 15.

A sixth child was rescued alive and taken to the hospital, they said.

In all, seven houses were swept away in landslides in the city, and another four people injured. Seventy-one families were forced from their homes, officials said.

Two more victims were killed in the cities of Mesquita and Angra dos Reis, where another 13 people remain missing, said Congressman Marcelo Freixo, who represents the state of 17.5 million people.

In Angra, the victim was a four-year-old girl buried in a landslide, while in Mesquita, 40km (25 miles) northwest of Rio de Janeiro city, a 38-year-old man was electrocuted trying to help another person escape the flooding, media reports said.

The storms turned streets into rivers in several cities on Friday night, sweeping up cars and triggering landslides – a frequent tragedy in the rainy season, especially in poor hillside communities.

Officials in Angra said the city had received 655 millimetres (26 inches) of rain in 48 hours, “levels never before registered in the municipality”.

The federal government said it had sent military aircraft to help the local rescue effort, and dispatched national disaster response secretary Alexandre Lucas to the state.

Experts have said rainy season downpours in Brazil are being augmented by La Nina – the cyclical cooling of the Pacific Ocean – and by the impact of climate change.

As a hotter atmosphere holds more water, global warming increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.

In January, torrential rain triggered floods and landslides that killed at least 28 people in southeastern Brazil, mostly in Sao Paulo state.

A study published Friday in Science Advances found that under a high- emissions scenario—in a world where we do nothing to stop current levels of emissions—the frequency of back-to-back wildfires and rainfall events would increase seven times by 2100 in the Pacific Northwest and become twice as likely in California. The combo of fire and rain sets the stage for landslides , which can sweep away homes in an instant.

“We know those things are happening anyway, so let’s think about how likely it is within a single year both of them would happen—a fire, and then a rainstorm afterwards,” Samantha Stevenson, an assistant professor of environmental science at University of California, Santa Barbara and a coauthor of the study, told Earther. “We care about that because that has a much bigger impact than either of those things just happening individually.”

Both wildfires and heavy rainfall can be devastating on their own, but when rain falls on areas that haven’t fully recovered from fire, the effects can be catastrophic. Wildfires burn off a crucial layer of vegetation that helps to capture some of the water during rainfall, slowing down the water on its way into the soil. When heavy rains fall on areas scarred by wildfires, that barrier doesn’t exist, making debris flows (the more scientifically appropriate name for “mud slides,” since a lot of stuff besides mud can get caught up in the currents) much more likely. Fires also change the chemical composition of the soil itself, causing runoff to increase and upping the likelihood of severe erosion in certain areas.

T he study, which uses climate modeling to run different scenarios, examines the chance that wildfires and rainfall will coexist in a certain time period. “If you have two sets of dice, and one is for fire weather, and one is for rain, you could roll those independently, and some of the time you’d come up with, say, a six, and you’d get extreme fire or extreme rainfall,” Stevenson said. “That would happen by chance anyway. But what climate change is doing is loading those dice, so you’re more likely to get those extreme values.”

The findings aren’t particularly surprising; t he IPCC report published last year clearly laid the links between climate change supercharging rainstorms as well as helping wildfires get bigger and more destructive. B ut they’re extremely worrisome, given how devastating extreme rainfall can be to areas that have recently burned. Folks in the Pacific Northwest got a taste of what this future could look like last fall, when an atmospheric river dumped a torrent of rain on parts of British Columbia that had suffered through wildfires that summer. Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from towns and cities in the region, while at one point every major highway out of Vancouver was closed. Officials had to rescue nearly 300 people, including dozens of children, off a highway after they became trapped overnight by water, rocks, and mud.

Importantly, the study’s findings operate under a “business as usual” emissions scenario— projections that do not take into account any sort of climate action whatsoever and which are (hopefully) an overshoot of what actually will happen at the end of the century as the world tries to take decisive climate action now. However, even if the doomsday numbers the report projects are an overshoot, climate change has already upped the risk of wildfires and rainfall occurring in tandem.

“The increase in risk is already here,” Stevenson said. “It will get worse than it is now—the question is just by how much.”",debris_flow,rain,"California, Santa Barbara",34.41938000000010,-119.69905000000000,9.797,2021-09-01 00:00:00,2021-11-30 23:59:59,"2021/10/16, 11:59",1092.0,

They have been identified as 50-year-old Nagen Barman and Tapas Rai, 15, while Kusum Rai, 35, has yet to be rescued, Itanagar Police Station Commander Phassang Simi said.

Most parts of the state have experienced heavy rainfall in recent days, with landslides from several districts, officials said.

The government has designated the government high school here, the government high school in Naharlagun and Nikum Niya Hall in Banderdewa as temporary relief camps, they said.

Freelance insurance agent Dina Liz Ismail, 37, said part of the slope next to their house on Laluan Lapangan 3 gave way during a thunderstorm just before dawn on Sunday (May 15).

""There was a blackout at about 5am, and we could see muddy water flowing on the road in front of our house and down the slope.

""At about 6am, the perimeter wall started to crack and then collapsed along with part of the slope,"" she said.

""It was a scary moment for us as this was totally unexpected,"" she added.

Dina Liz said the structure of the house had been checked by the developer and was found to be still stable.

""The developer said it would repair the damage and put us up at a nearby homestay,"" she said, adding that the repairs could take about two weeks.

A Fire and Rescue Department spokesman said they received a call about the incident at about 7am.

""Shortly after we arrived, we inspected the location to ensure that no one was hurt.

""We advised the affected house owner and two other residents living near the landslide to vacate their homes for now,"" he said.

Residents' association chairman Datuk Zul Zukree Zakaria said he believed that the landslide was caused by a nearby development project.

""Since the project started about two years ago, there have been numerous flash floods here.

""This time, part of the slope collapsed,"" he said.

""We hope the Ipoh City Council will (view) this matter seriously and take action before more incidents happen,"" he added.

Former lecturer Noah Wong, who has been living in the area for almost a decade, said the roads outside their houses often flooded when it rains heavily.

""It has become worse over the past year and it's just a matter of time before the water enters our houses,"" the 57-year-old said.

Meanwhile, Gopeng MCA vice chairman Cally Ting said she would try to find a solution to the constant flash floods there.

""We will meet with all the relevant parties, including the developer of the project and the mayor.

""Some 106 residents have collected signatures to be passed to the mayor asking him to look into the issues here.

""We all want to find out the main cause of the flash floods and resolve it,"" she said.

Former Ipoh city councillor Kok Pak Foo said there had been two landslides along the road in the area.

""I believe the drainage system can no longer accommodate the amount of water that flows through, especially when it rains heavily.

""A lot of new houses are also being built nearby,"" said Kok, who is also a Gopeng MCA vice-chairman.

Ipoh Timur MP Wong Kah Woh said the pre-dawn downpour and thunderstorm caused several areas in his constituency to be flooded.

He said these included Kampung Seri Kinta, Kampung Pasir Puteh and Taman Pengkalan Harapan, with more than 50 houses affected.

""We urge the city council to find the root cause of the flooding.

""Areas that have never been flooded are now getting inundated,"" he said.

About 187 residents had to relocate from the La Baie district after a landslide destroyed a house last week. Dominic Arseneau, a spokesperson for the city of Saguenay, said the city declared a local state of emergency Saturday night and planned to make an official request Monday evening to the province to extend it.

The evacuated area, Arseneau said in an interview, remains unstable and other landslides are “imminent and inevitable.”

“We know it’s going to happen, we just don’t know when,” he added.

Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters Monday she was waiting on the official request from the city before signing the state of emergency order. She said the declaration would allow Saguenay to sidestep the usual paperwork and more easily requisition property, sign contracts and redirect traffic.

“We need a good reason to declare state of emergency, but it’s rare that a municipality will ask for it if they don’t need to,” Guilbault said.

Arseneau said emergency levees have been erected in the affected part of the city to avoid any more displacement and to stop debris and mud from sliding further into the area.

Several groups have offered to shelter displaced families, most of whom had a few hours to pack their belongings and didn’t know whether they would be able to return to their homes.

Marie-Chantale Tremblay says she called her mother, 57, and stepfather, 66, slightly before 10 p.m. on Saturday after seeing on social media that people were evacuating the La Baie neighbourhood.

“My mom didn’t believe it at first, but everything happened so quickly,” Tremblay said Monday in an interview. “We tried to take as much as we could … They left their home, the memories behind.”

Contact Nature, a non-profit that owns two campgrounds in La Baie, is one of the groups that have offered to provide free accommodation to the families affected by the landslides. Its CEO, Marc-André Galbrand, says that five families, including Tremblay’s, have contacted him.

“There are no words; we are devastated like everyone else by what is happening,” Galbrand said in an interview Monday. “We will do everything we can to make the transition as easy as possible.”

Meanwhile, residents were scheduled to meet on Monday with government officials about the different types of assistance programs available to people who are searching for emergency accommodation. Each person who was forced from their home will receive $20 a day for living expenses, the public security department said.

Quebec is also offering $260,000 to those who won’t be able to return to their homes, Guilbault said.

“The city of Saguenay suffered a lot in the past,” she said about the natural disasters that have hit the city. “Right now, people are very proactive because of it, but at one point, people are fed up. We will be there; we know it’s difficult.”

Didier Perret, a research scientist with Natural Resources Canada who has been studying landslides in the Saguenay area since 1996, says the region is known for its unstable clay soil. The city, Perret added, meets a lot of the criteria for landslides.

The affected district is located on a hill with a steep incline, and recent heavy rains have made the soil particularly unstable, he said.

Hundreds of residents of Saint-Jean-Vianney, Que., also in the Saguenay region, were left without homes in May 1971, after a major landslide swept through the community, killing 31 people. In 1996, the Chicoutimi River flooded, triggering landslides and causing damage that killed at least 10 people, forcing thousands from their homes.

“Those events are still remembered,” Perret said. “When landslides happen, it brings back bad memories.”

Regional Executive Director Gwendolyn Bambalan of the DENR issued the statement after conducting an investigation to determine the cause of a landslide which covers an approximate average width of 90 meters and total height of 1,592 meters above sea level.

The landslide took place at Sitio Diariong, Barangay Villa Gracia, Maddela, Quirino.

“The landslide incident was a natural occurrence due to heavy rains,” stressed director Bambalan.

The investigating team was composed of personnel from the Community Environment and Natural Resources Offices of San Isidro in Isabela and Nagtipunan in Quirino and the local government units of San Agustin and Maddela towns.

Bambalan added that the area is covered with mossy forest and limestone rock formation within the Quirino Protected Landscape.

She also noted that the team discovered bedrocks and boulders along the Sili Creek found at the foot of the incident area, and discolored flowing water from the top of the landslide site.

Bambalan also noted the absence of inhabitants or community in the area and that no traces of illegal activities were found in the site and nearby areas.

The investigators spent almost a week to reach the exact location of the landslide in the mountain.

The agency has yet to ascertain the condition of the uppermost area of the mountain and determine what possibly caused the landslide incident.

The DENR together with the Mines and Geosciences Bureau has scheduled aerial surveillance in coordination with proper authorities to identify what caused the landslide.

The DENR conducted the investigation after a netizen posted on his Facebook account photos of landslide with caption ‘Mahal naming Sierra Madre, bakit may sugat ka, sana’y huwag lumala ang sugat mo. Sanay mapansin natin ito.’

The post went viral in social media with 17,000 reactions when shared by Philippine Weather System/Pacific Storm Update.

The order came as photos of the alleged landslide posted on social media captured the attention of netizens.

Bambalan said the agency and the Mines and Geosciences Bureau or MGB have already formed an investigating team that will go to San Agustin in Isabela to investigate the real cause of the landslide.

Initial information gathered by Bambalan revealed that a crater at the top of the mountain could have been the cause of the landslide triggered by heavy rains.

The DENR had also sought the help of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in Isabela for an aerial survey to determine if indeed there is a crater on top of the mountain.

About 14 women were looking for gold grains Thursday in a pit roughly 2 meters (6.5 feet) deep at a small and unauthorized traditional gold mine in a remote village of North Sumatra’s Mandailing Natal district when a landslide plunged down surrounding hills and buried them, said local police chief Marlon Rajagukguk.

A two-hour search and rescue operation managed to rescue two injured women and pulled the bodies of 12 other women from the rubble, Rajagukguk said.

He said authorities have closed illegal gold pits in the area, which was a main source of gold to be panned traditionally by villagers before Thursday’s landslide happened.

Informal mining operations are commonplace in Indonesia, providing a tenuous livelihood to thousands who labor in conditions with a high risk of serious injury or death.

Landslides, flooding and collapses of tunnels are just some of the hazards facing miners. Much of gold ore processing involves highly toxic mercury and cyanide and workers frequently use little or no protection.

The country’s last major mining-related accident occurred in February 2019 when a makeshift wooden structure in an illegal gold mine in North Sulawesi province collapsed due to shifting soil and the large number of mining holes. More than 40 people died, buried in the mine pit.

A collapsed cliff in North Sumatra’s Mandailing Natal district struck Thursday afternoon, killing 12 women - aged 30 to 55 years old - who were digging for gold in an abandoned illegal mine.

“The cliff around the mine collapsed and buried the 12 women, killing them all,” local police chief Marlon Rajagukguk told AFP late Thursday, adding that the victims were not professional miners.

Two other women who worked alongside them managed to survive the disaster and ran back to the village to report the incident to the authorities.

Illegal gold mining is rampant in the Mandailing Natal, about 300-kilometer (186 miles) south of the provincial capital of Medan, and several sites are abandoned by the operators.

Mining accidents are frequent across the archipelago due to landslides, especially during the monsoon summer months.

Last year six miners died when an illegal gold mine collapsed in Parigi Moutong on the island of Sulawesi.

In 2020, 11 miners in Sumatra were killed in a landslide triggered by heavy rains.

“The cliff around the mine collapsed and buried the 12 women, killing them all,” local police chief Marlon Rajagukguk told AFP late Thursday, adding that the victims were not professional miners.

Two other women who worked alongside them managed to survive the disaster and ran back to the village to report the incident to the authorities.

It took hours for rescuers to evacuate the victims’ bodies as they were in a two-metre deep hole, which was filled with mud.

“Now all the bodies of the victims have been returned to their family,” Rajagukguk said.

Illegal gold mining is rampant in the Mandailing Natal, about 300 km (186 miles) south of the provincial capital of Medan, and several sites are abandoned by the operators.

Mining accidents are frequent across the archipelago due to landslides, especially during the monsoon summer months.

Last year six miners died when an illegal gold mine collapsed in Parigi Moutong on the island of Sulawesi.

In 2020, 11 miners in Sumatra were killed in a landslide triggered by heavy rains.

An 11-year-old boy survived a landslide in the Philippines by hiding in a refrigerator all day. According to the New York Post, the boy named CJ Jasme was at home with his family when a massive mudslide flooded their home in Baybay City, Philippines, on Friday. Authorities discovered that Jasme was inside the broken device when they conducted a rescue operation in Leyte Province in the wake of Tropical Storm Megi.

As the mudslide poured into his home, the quick-thinking 11-year-old jumped into the family’s refrigerator. He then spent about 20 hours in the device protecting himself from the storm. The rescue finally came when the rescue team spotted the refrigerator on a riverbank, whereupon they sent out an SOS message when another landslide came in.

According to the After, police officer Jonas Etis said the rescue crew subsequently evacuated Jasme. They hefted the broken device from the mud like a coffin and then transferred the 11-year-old onto a makeshift stretcher. The team said the child’s first words to them were, “I’m hungry.”

Jasme was conscious and only miraculously broke a leg during the ordeal. He then received first aid and was taken to hospital, where he had surgery on his broken leg.

Police have now announced that the boy is in stable condition. However, they also said that Jasme’s family was not lucky. His mother and younger sibling are still missing, while his father was killed in another landslide that destroyed his home the day before. His 13-year-old brother is said to have escaped the disaster.

Meanwhile, it should be noted that after the storm, nearly 200 villagers are reported to have been injured in Baybay alone and about 172 people have been killed. According to the NY Post, officials said the storm also forced more than 200 million people to leave the region.

Keifang village lies along the 186-kilometre-long main road that connects Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram and Champhai, a town situated near the India-Myanmar border.

Vehicular movement along the road has come to a halt as a result of landslide and rock-fall.

The landslide has also led to disruptions in human movements as well with hundreds of commuters getting stuck at the Aizawl-Champhai road in Mizoram on May 4.

As per reports, efforts are ongoing to clear the road as soon as possible so that the movement of vehicles along this vital route resumes.

Notably, owing to its terrain, landslides happen to be a common phenomenon across the northeastern states with many getting affected every year as a result of it.

Earlier, in an unfortunate incident, three members of a family were buried alive in a heavy landslide in Arunachal Pradesh's Kurung Kumey district near the China border.

As per the reports, the victims were identified as 50-year-old Sariu Tongdang, his wife Sariu Yajik (48), and their eight-year-old son Sariu Takar.

Heavy and incessant rains were creating havoc and fear among the citizens of the state over the past few days.

Heavy and incessant rain on April 17 triggered landslides in different locations, especially in the district headquarters here, disrupting surface communication, water, and electricity supply.

Following the havoc, the district headquarters remained cut off from the rest of the state as the roads were blocked in several places between the old DC office and the mini secretariat in Malapu.

Brenda Ballou, a spokesperson for the city, told CNN a few hundred people live in Lowell Point, an unincorporated, heavily-visited tourist area on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage.

Marissa Beck, who owns a rental property in Seward, told CNN there are many cabins and rental houses in the area, and guests are now stuck in town or cannot get to their rentals. Many people are taking water taxis or their own boats to get to the other side of the slide.

No one was hurt when the slide occurred, Seward City Manager Janette Bower said in a Facebook post Saturday, and Ballou confirmed.

Nathaniel Caole was headed to walk his dogs on Saturday evening when he noticed a commotion on Lowell Road and pulled off to the side of the road to see what was happening. He noticed a boulder was blocking a part of the road, and cops were stopping traffic from passing by.

Video by Josh Gray.)

Work to clear Lowell Point Road in Seward after a significant landslide Saturday evening hadn’t begun Sunday because of continuing safety concerns, the city reported.

The public is requested to stay clear of the road along Resurrection Bay for their own safety after a slide — estimated at 200-feet high and 300-feet wide — buried the road on Saturday night and has cut off access between Seward and the community of Lowell Point to the south. It is unknown how long the road will remain closed, the city said Sunday.

“It’s not stable still,” said City Clerk Brenda Ballou said. “Until we’re very, very positive that that’s a very stable environment, the work will not begin so the roads are still cut off.”

City officials met with local contractor Metco Alaska on Sunday morning to discuss debris removal, Ballou said. Metco Alaska has begun mobilizing equipment in preparation, but the work cannot begin until the area is safe.

“It may be over 40,000 cubic yards of debris that will have to be removed,” Ballou said.

While enormous boulders have already come down during the landslide, it’s hard to tell if the boulders above are stable or loose, Ballou said.

“It could get more or it could just settle down; We don’t know yet,” she said.

City officials continue to monitor and assess the situation from land and water and using drone footage, the city said in a written update Sunday morning.

After the slide occurred around 7:40 p.m. on Saturday, the City of Seward has declared an emergency, and officials started asking people to stay away from the area.

”We’re all pulling together. There’s no loss of life. And we’re super happy about that,” Seward City Manager Janette Bower said. She noted it could take a week to clear the road.

Seward police in an alert advised vessels in the vicinity of Resurrection Bay that the slide “generated a large floating debris field that includes a number of full sized trees.”

Photos and video of the slide showed a pileup of trees, dirt and debris that broke away from the steep slope above the road and crossed into the water below.

Josh Gray, 33, was driving out Lowell Point Road to camp for the night and meet a group of friends who’d gone halibut fishing earlier in the day.

They were stopped at a small rockslide, and watched with a few other cars as a loader chipped away at the pile. Then, some bigger rocks started tumbling down from the slope.

”Once the trees fell, it was like watching dominoes,” he said. “We’re all looking up at the hillside wondering how high up it’s going to go.”

The Saturday evening response drew Bower, the city police and fire chiefs and Seward’s public works director.

Those officials estimated that there were a couple hundred people — residents and weekend campers — stuck on the far side of the landslide, which cuts off 2 miles of dead-end road.

“Lowell Point has maybe 200-ish residents normally and we have a lot of visitors here though already,” Ballou said. “So it’s really unknown how many additional people might be affected.”

The water taxis are running between Miller’s landing and the Seward Harbor to help visitors and residents, Ballou said.

The taxis can run supplies, and a fire boat can respond to any emergencies, Bower said.

Anyone displaced by the landslide can seek shelter at Seward High School, city officials said. Shelter inquiries can be directed to Jason Bickling at 907-491-0803.

City officials described Lowell Point Road as critical infrastructure, and made note of “city wastewater and electric lines that run the length of that road.”

Gray and the group of friends accompanying him were left searching for a new spot to camp Saturday night. The worst part for them was that the slide left the halibut stuck on one side, and the fixings on the other.

”We’ve got the flour and the butter and the eggs and all the tartar sauce,” Gray said. “The menu’s kind of split.”
