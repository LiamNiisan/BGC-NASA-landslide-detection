“As of now, there is no report of any damage from any part of the district,” the DDC said. The deputy commissioners of these districts have issued advisories asking people to remain indoors in view of the flood-like situation developed in the mountainous belts.

According to a weather office forecast, heavy rain is predicted in the Kishtwar district which may cause temporary disruption of air and surface traffic mainly on the national highway and hilly roads, besides land landslides and shooting stones in vulnerable spots of the highway, according to the advisory issued by the district administration.

The district administrations have also issued helpline numbers in case of any emergency.

Police said the bodies of a nine-year-old boy and his 49-year-old father were recovered near Wentworth Pass at around 9.30am on Tuesday.

Five members of the same family were caught in the landslide on Monday while on holiday in Australia from the UK.

A 50-year-old woman and a 14-year-old boy were winched out and taken to hospital on Monday afternoon with significant head and abdominal injuries.

Police say they have undergone surgery and remain in critical conditions.

A fifth member of the family, a 15-year-old girl, was treated for shock after the landslip on a walking track, which was reported to emergency services about 1.40pm on Monday.

The Wentworth Pass track is a steep and difficult 5km loop, that encompasses waterfalls and valley views and can take up to five hours to complete.

A spokesperson for the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) said the track had been inspected in the days before the incident.

“The site is currently closed and a comprehensive review will be undertaken,” they said.

“The walking track where this incident occurred was inspected in the days before the rockslide as part of a routine track assessment program.

“NPWS has a world class program in place to assess geotechnical risks and maintain the safety of walking tracks and other infrastructure to the greatest extent practicable. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict and eliminate all natural risks such as rockslides, which can occasionally occur around the state.

“All of us at NPWS extend our heartfelt sympathies to the family and those affected.”

NSW Ambulance chief superintendent Stewart Clarke told Sunrise earlier on Tuesday that all indications were that it was a “freak accident.”

“Everything we can glean from the notes during the calls [indicates] that certainly it was a freak accident.

“What was concerning more so after the fact was the concern that there were still noises being heard after the initial impact, which poses a significant risk to the patients as well as our people being sent in.”

Clarke added that a multi-agency rescue effort was launched on Monday afternoon to rescue the family, which included NSW police, Fire and Rescue NSW and NSW SES.

“These people who work tirelessly for us are the best in what they do,” Clarke said.

“They are highly trained and highly skilled but that doesn’t negate the intense risk assessments that were carried out at the time to ensure they were able to use these skills safely to access the patients to deliver some high level clinical care.”

NSW police Det Acting Supt John Nelson said: “Unfortunately there’s been a landslip while they’ve been bushwalking. It’s quite a tragic scene.”

He described the 15-year-old as being “extremely distressed”.

“Both patients have significant head and abdominal injuries requiring sedation and intubation prior to them being extricated via winch,” Clarke told reporters on Monday.



The landslip had occurred in an “extremely dangerous, extremely unstable environment”, Clarke said, describing the situation as heartbreaking.

“It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event,” Clarke said.



He described the rescue operation as “complex and delicate”, with crews working hard to access patients in rugged bushland and on unstable ground.

Blue Mountains mayor Mark Greenhill told the Guardian the local community was heartbroken by the tragedy.

“Whether resident here or not, those who come to our beautiful Blue Mountains are taken into our hearts, and moments like this cause pain and grief to our entire community.”

“This was the holiday of a lifetime for a family that came from overseas, and has ended in unspeakable tragedy, and our whole community feels this.”

While the incident did not occur on council jurisdiction, Greenhill said the Blue Mountains City Council was working with National Parks and Wildlife Service in assessing walking tracks in the area.

Significant rain is predicted later this week. “As a result, Blue Mountains national park will be closed, except for Evans and Govetts Leap lookouts, from 9am” on Wednesday, the NPWS said in a statement on Tuesday.

Greg Tannos runs Find My Australia, a sports and recreation blog, and walked the Wentworth Pass track two days before the tragic landslip, saying he didn’t see anything dangerous.

“I actually thought the trail was quite OK when we walked it. These more off the grid tracks are a little less maintained, but that’s normal, most people won’t go that far down.

“I honestly didn’t think the trail looked damaged, and it didn’t seem to be overly soggy or wet down there.”

Tannos said he was shocked to hear of a landslide on the track calling it “just a terrible tragedy”.

“We passed over a small slide, but it looked like it had been there for a few months, there was nothing dangerous. There was nothing that gave me an indication something like this would happen.

A 50-year-old woman and a 14-year-old boy were winched from the location in critical condition, according to New South Wales Police.

The last member of the family, a 15-year-old girl, was walked back by emergency services - an hour-and-a-half trek from the scene - and has been taken to a children’s hospital. The young girl, who escaped the landslide, reportedly raised the alarm in call to the emergency services at around 1:30pm, Mail Online reported.

The distraught teenager allegedly told the operator: “I don’t know where we are.” The family were holidaying in Australia and had gone walking in the mountains.

The 15-year-old girl was “extremely distressed” following the incident, the authorities said. “We’ve focused on caring for her while the best medical care is given to her mum and brother and just trying to get that support for the 15-year-old,” said Supt John Nelson from New South Wales Police.

At around 1.40pm local time on Monday, emergency services were called to Wentworth Pass, Wentworth Falls, after “reports of a concern for welfare for five bushwalkers”, police said in a statement.

The bodies of the British father and his 9-year-old son have now been recovered, police confirmed on Tuesday.

New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet called the incident “tragic” and said he will be investigating whether the walking track should have been open at the time.

He told the Australian Broadcasting Corportation: “These tragedies occur too often so anything we can do to keep people safe, we will.

“Obviously, the Blue Mountains is a place where people love to go trekking. It’s one of the wonders of the world but when those tragedies occur it would be remiss of any government not to act.”

Police said on Monday: “Despite efforts by emergency services, two people – a 49-year-old man and a nine-year-old boy – died at the scene.

“Just before 6pm, a 50-year-old woman and second boy – aged 14 – were winched from the location and taken to Westmead Hospital and the children’s hospital at Westmead, both in critical conditions.”

Det Supt John Nelson, from the Blue Mountains area command, told reporters: “It’s quite a tragic scene. We do have a girl who is walking out at the moment and is clearly extremely distressed.”

NSW Ambulance Acting Ch Supt Stewart Clarke said that the area the family had been walking in was extremely dangerous and unstable.

He added: “This was a really complex and delicate rescue operation for our crews who were working to access patients in rugged bushland and were navigating unstable ground.”

“This is absolutely heartbreaking for all involved and a truly tragic ending to what I’m sure was meant to be a pleasant day out,” he said.

“It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event.”

More devastating details have emerged about the plight of the British family at the centre of a fatal landslip tragedy at Wentworth Falls, west of Sydney, on Monday afternoon.

The father, 49, and young son, nine, were crushed to death while his wife, 50, and another son, 14, are now fighting for life in hospital in a critical condition.

The 15-year-old girl who escaped the landslip raised the alarm in a frantic call to emergency services at around 1.30pm.

The family were on holiday in Australia at the time and it’s understood the distraught teen told the emergency services operator: ‘I don’t know where we are.’

She walked from the scene with emergency crews, which involved trekking for an hour-and-a-half along a hiking track.

Police said the girl was uninjured but ‘extremely distressed’ and was later treated by paramedics for shock before being taken to hospital.

The girl is now being hailed as a hero by emergency responders who attended the scene.

Crews returned to the scene early on Tuesday morning to recover the bodies of the man and boy.

The retrieval of the bodies will be a planned and delicate operation due to the nature of the terrain at the site.

Blue Mountains Area Command acting superintendent John Nelson said the bodies of the father and boy were still at the scene of the landslide on Tuesday morning.

Speaking to radio station 2GB, Mr Nelson said emergency services were focused on caring for the two critically injured members of the family yesterday.

‘That obviously takes some time, it’s a good 90-minute walk into where the landslip had occurred and the site is quite dangerous,’ he said.

‘They had to make that site as safe as possible for the rescue squads to provide that care, so hence we’re still in the recovery phase for the two people who didn’t survive.’

‘Everything we can glean from the notes during the call suggest it was a freak accident,’ NSW Ambulance chief superintendent Stewart Clarke told Sunrise on Tuesday.

‘What was concerning more so after the fact was the concern that there were still noises being heard after the initial impact, which poses a significant risks to the patients as well as our people being sent in.’

A multi-agency rescue operation was launched to retrieve the family from the 5km Wentworth Pass loop track after the alarm was raised shortly before 1pm on Monday.

It’s understood several bushwalkers on the track assisted rescue workers after coming across the harrowing scenes.

Getting to the victims safely was a difficult operation for emergency crews.

‘These people who work tirelessly for us are the best in what they do,’ Supt Clarke said.

‘They are highly trained and highly skilled but that doesn’t negate the intense risk assessments that were carried out at the time to ensure they were able to use these skills safely to access the patients to deliver some high level clinical care.’

The woman and 14-year-old boy, who suffered severe head and abdominal injuries, had to be sedated before being winched from the trail by paramedics on Monday night.

They were airlifted to Westmead Hospital and the Children’s Hospital and have both undergone emergency surgery, but remain in a critical condition.

A teenage boy and woman have been airlifted to hospital in critical conditions, while a fifth member of the family – a 15-year-old girl – was uninjured

It’s since been revealed the family were permitted to use a treacherous bushwalking trail despite weeks of torrential rain making the area dangerous for hikers.

A video posted by sports and recreation blog ‘Find My Australia’ shows hikers winding their way down the steep cliff and up muddy embankments on the weekend.

The clip highlights the precarious nature of the valley walk, which features sharp descents down narrow stone stairways and towering walls of rock.

Rescuers had struggled to access the victims due not only to the remote location, but the hazardous terrain and unstable trail because of days of heavy downpours across the Blue Mountains.

The Wentworth Pass track is notoriously steep and is considered as having a grade four difficulty under NSW National Park and Wildlife Service guidelines, which recommends only experienced bushwalkers use it.

Despite the muddy, slippery conditions, NSW Police said the part of the track where the tragedy happened was open to the public.

Several areas around Wentworth Falls have been closed since March 11 due to flood damage, with a major landslip recently shutting down Kedumba Valley Road, which is next to the trail.

National Pass, another trail about 350 metres away from Monday’s deadly incident, has also been closed for the past few weeks due to an ‘ongoing rockfall risk’.

A man who was at the popular tourist spot about the same time as the Brits on Monday told Daily Mail Australia he cautiously cut his hike short because the ground was muddy and stairways were wet and he’d recently suffered a leg injury on a trek.

In an post an hour after the tragedy, trail running organiser Ultra-Trail Australia announced the Wentworth Falls track was due to be upgraded later this week to make sure it was safe in time for their upcoming event.

‘We’ve been working closely with [National Parks and Council teams] to ensure that our courses will be good to go come 12-15 May, and we’re confident that they will be ready in five weeks time,’ the group wrote on their Facebook page about 2.30pm.

‘Parks has asked us to let you all know about a few upcoming track closures this week on Thursday 7th and Friday 8th of April (weather dependent), which include sections of course near Fairmont Resort and Wentworth Falls.’

However, hours after the deaths, NSW National Park and Wildlife Service announced the section would be closed indefinitely.

‘The Wentworth Falls and Valley of the Waters precincts are closed following a rockfall incident,’ the department wrote on their website.

‘Please avoid this area until further notice.’

Hiking fanatics who visited the same trail in recent days have expressed their shock and offered condolences to the British family online.

‘This is the trail we completed two days earlier and were unaware of any dangers at the time,’ they wrote on Facebook.

‘Our thoughts are with the families of these walkers’.

The family were holidaying in Australia from the UK, NSW Police have confirmed, and the British Consulate is now assisting.

Authorities are still working to determine whether the landslide fell on the group while they were walking along a bush track, or if they were trekking along the cliff face that fell.

In an eerie post an hour after the tragedy, trail running organiser Ultra-Trail Australia announced the Wentworth Falls track was due to be upgraded later this week to make sure it was safe in time for their upcoming event

‘Unfortunately there’s been a landslip while they were bushwalking and a man and a boy have passed away,’ Mr Nelson told reporters.

‘In terms of the site, it’s extremely dangerous and unstable.

‘Two other patients are critical, with head and abdominal injuries, requiring sedation before extraction.’

NSW Ambulance superintendent Stewart Clarke added: ‘This is absolutely heartbreaking for all involved and a truly tragic ending to what I’m sure was meant to be a pleasant day out.

‘It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event.

‘This was a really complex and delicate rescue operation for our crews who were working to access patients in rugged bushland and were navigating unstable ground.’

Rescue efforts have been hampered by the treacherous terrain, which has been ‘unstable’ due to recent rainfall

The rescue operation also involved local police, Police Rescue, Fire and Rescue NSW, National Parks & Wildlife Services, Blue Mountains detectives, and PolAir and rescue helicopters

Blue Mountains mayor Mark Greenhill offered his thoughts to the victims, their family, and friends.

‘Whether resident here or not, those who come within our beautiful Blue Mountains are taken to our hearts,’ Mr Greenhill said.

‘Moments like this cause pain and grief to our entire Blue Mountains family.’

Seven paramedic road crews including special operations paramedics and two rescue helicopters with a critical care doctor and a critical care paramedic on board were dispatched to the scene.

The department simultaneously warned of heavy rainfall in several other areas, including Assam and other northeastern states, and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala in the south.

A seasonally unusual deluge ahead of the annual monsoon in the northeastern state of Assam has left at least eight people dead and displaced more than 400,000 as of Wednesday.

Four of the victims were killed when their house was buried in a remote village in Dima Hasao district, where landslides undermined railway lines in several areas, making it difficult for authorities to send relief material.

One train was pushed off the tracks by muddy debris from surrounding hills.

The Indian Army, which has been brought in for rescue operations, said in a statement that it had rescued around 300 villagers as of Wednesday.

Guwahati:

Fresh landslides were reported from various parts of Guwahati on Wednesday, amid incessant rainfall, which also led to heavy flooding in most parts of the city, officials said.

During the day there were no reports of new casualties.

The state has recorded 42 deaths this year from flooding and landslides, including four that were buried under a massive mound of earth in the Boragaon area on Tuesday.

An official of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) told PTI that accumulation of debris caused by landslides has blocked passageways in the Geetanagar, Sonapur, Kalapahar and Nijarapar areas.

Heavy rainfall has also flooded roads in several parts of the city – the worst affected among them are Anil Nagar, Nabin Nagar, Rajgarh Link Road, Rukminigaon, Hatigaon and Krishna Nagar.

NDRF and SDRF personnel, deployed in these areas, are using boats to rescue people and offer relief supplies to those still trapped in flooded homes, the official said.

Assam Power Distribution Company Limited (APDCL) is working around the clock to restore power in the city, which has been in darkness since Tuesday, while drinking water tankers have been sent to the flooded areas.

The Kamrup Metropolitan district administration has urged people to leave their homes only if they have urgent or essential work.

Kamrup Metropolitan Deputy Commissioner Pallav Gopal Jha has issued an order ordering all schools, colleges and educational institutions to suspend classes in the wake of a rain alert issued by the Regional Meteorological Center (RMC).

The RMC issued a ‘red alert’ for Assam and Meghalaya and forecast isolated and scattered ‘extremely heavy rain’ from Tuesday to Thursday, and ‘orange alert’ for Friday and Saturday.

A bulletin issued by the ASDMA said the flooding situation in several parts of the state is grim, with eight districts being inundated by rising waters in the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries.

""As of 6:00 pm (2100 GMT) this Sunday, the number of people killed as a result of the rains has reached 79,"" the civil defense authority of Pernambuco state, where the affected communities of Recife and Olinda are located, said in a statement.

The disaster is the latest in a recent series of deadly landslides and floods triggered by extreme weather in Brazil.

The number of dead has mounted steadily over the weekend, including dozens in landslides, as heavy rains caused rivers to overflow and torrents of mud swept away everything in their path.

The latest statement from the civil defense did not offer an update on the number of people missing, though the agency had earlier reported 56 people still unaccounted for and nearly 4,000 who had lost their homes.

""We still don't have an exact number, but there are still reports of victims... who have not been found,"" Pernambuco Governor Paulo Camara said during a press conference.

""The search will continue until we can identify all the missing people,"" he said.

Authorities warned that rain was forecast to continue Monday, but in the meantime while the storm subsided some 1,200 personnel -- some in boats or helicopters -- resumed search and rescue work, state officials said.

Minister of Regional Development Daniel Ferreira urged caution in a press conference Sunday in Recife, the capital of hard-hit northeastern Pernambuco state.

""Although it has stopped raining now, we are forecasting heavy rains for the next few days,"" he said.

""So the first thing is to maintain self-protection measures.""

Between Friday night and Saturday morning, rainfall volume reached 70 percent of what was forecast for all of May in some parts of Recife.

'Difficult'

Images circulated on local media showed rescue workers and volunteers clearing heaps of debris in Jardim Monteverde, on the border between Recife and the municipality of Jaboatao dos Guararapes, where 19 died Saturday morning in a landslide that ripped through precariously built homes.

Luiz Estevao Aguiar, who lives in a different municipality, lost 11 relatives in the disaster, he told TV Globo.

""My sister, my brother-in-law, 11 people from my family died. It was difficult... I did not expect this,"" he said tearfully.

Nearby, Flavio Jose da Silva has been desperately looking for his stepfather Gilvan in the rubble of what was once his house.

Shortly after it collapsed, he heard Gilvan say, ""I'm here, under the ground.""

""We hope to find him alive,"" an emotional da Silva said, pointing to a mountain of debris.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Sunday he would travel to Recife on Monday.

Over the past year, hundreds of Brazilians have died in flooding and landslides brought on by torrential downpours.

In February, more than 230 people were killed in the city of Petropolis, the Brazilian then-empire's 19th-century summer capital, in Rio de Janeiro state.

Early last month 14 more were killed by flooding and landslides in the state.

Experts say Brazil's rainy-season downpours are being augmented by La Nina -- the cyclical cooling of the Pacific Ocean -- and by climate change.

Because a hotter atmosphere holds more water, global warming increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.

Risks from heavy rains are augmented by topography and poor construction in shantytowns built in steep areas.

According to meteorologist Estael Sias of the MetSul agency, the heavy rains lashing Pernambuco and, to a lesser extent, four other northeastern states, are the product of a typical seasonal phenomenon called ""eastern waves.""

He explained that those are areas of atmospheric disturbance that move from Africa to Brazil's northeastern coastal region.

""In other areas of the Atlantic this instability forms hurricanes, but in northeastern Brazil it has the potential for a lot of rain and even thunderstorms,"" he said.

Landslides caused by heavy rains killed nearly 30 people in the metropolitan region of Recife, the capital of northeastern Pernambuco state, authorities said.

“In the last 24 hours, 28 deaths have been recorded,” the Civil Defence said in a statement on Saturday.

More than 760 people have been forced to leave their homes because of the flooding in Pernambuco, civil defence officials said on Twitter.

The executive secretary of the civil defence agency in Pernambuco, Lieutenant Colonel Leonardo Rodrigues, said in a video posted on Instagram that about 32,000 families live in areas at risk of landslides or flooding in the state.

Schools in the city of Recife have been opened to receive the homeless.

In Alagoas, another state in the region, two people died when they were swept away in river flooding on Friday.

In Alagoas, the state government said 33 municipalities have declared an emergency due to the effects of the heavy rains in the past several days.

Videos posted on social media show wide flooded avenues in several municipalities, collapsing houses and landslides.

Between Friday night and Saturday morning, the volume of rainfall reached 236 millimetres (nine inches) in some parts of the Pernambuco capital, according to the mayor’s office.

Over the last few days heavy rainfall has triggered another wave of deadly landslides in urban areas in Brazil, this time in the Recife area. As of this morning reports indicate that 93 people have died in the rains, with 26 more missing.

One of the worst events occurred in the Jardim Monte Verde neighbourhood, in the southwest part of the metropolitan area of Recife. Here, a large landslide inundated a number of houses at the foot of the slope:-

.

This appears to be a landslide in heavy weathered and denuded residual soil, probably with some element of static liquefaction, judging by the debris and the runout. At least 20 people were killed at this site, including eleven members of a single family.

There were also landslides in Camaragibe city. UOL News has this image of another large failure in residual soil, with a possible smaller failure further around the slope:-

.

Reports indicate that at least six people have been killed in landslides in Camaragibe.

Globo has a before and after image of a landslide in the Cohab neighbourhood of Recife:-

.

Once again the deadly cost of urban landslides in Brazil is evident. The country has suffered multiple events of this type over the years, and more will occur in the future. A paper published a few years ago (Bandeiro and Coutinho 2015) recorded 214 landslide fatalities in the Recife area between 1984 and 2012, and noted that “… the management activities in risk areas in Brazil need to be upgraded (structural and non-structural actions). Many people are living in a risk situation on hillsides and it is impossible to eliminate this risk in the short term.”

NDRRMC Executive Director Ricardo Jalad said in a situational report that 130 deaths were still undergoing verification while seven deaths – six in Western Visayas (region 6) and one in Eastern Visayas – were already confirmed by the national disaster council.

In Leyte province, 128 people were reported dead in Baybay City and in the municipality of Abuyog where rampaging mud and soil buried several residential houses at the height of the storm earlier this week.

Aside from this, six persons in Western Visayas and three others in Davao (Region 11) were previously reported killed by the NDRRMC due to flooding and landslide.

“We are racing against time because the longer it gets, the harder it is for our rescuers to retrieve the victims,” Jalad said during a visit to Barangay Kantagnos, Baybay City on Maundy Thursday.

This will make it hard for authorities to verify the identities of the victims especially in Baybay City where 27 out of the 28 missing persons were reported, Jalad explained.

However, rescuers could not operate in certain areas in Baybay City, such as in Barangay Kantagnos, due to safety issues.

“We have to prioritize the safety of responders. We cannot penetrate the landslide area yet because the soil is still soft. It would be too dangerous for them,” the NDRRMC chief stressed.

Jalad also visited the Abuyog Community College in Abuyog town to personally oversee the situation of the evacuees, and the ongoing response operations and post-disaster activities.

“We have two primary efforts: first is to secure the welfare of evacuees which is being led by the local government units and supported by DSWD and other agencies. Second is the search, rescue and retrieval [operations] undertaken by the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, Philippine Army, Philippine Coast Guard, and response units of LGU),” he said.

Currently, the number of affected persons due to Agaton has ballooned to 494,607 families or 1,689,436 individuals.

The typhoon also displaced a total of 153,694 families or 323,306 individuals, including more than 218,000 who were staying in 1,033 evacuation centers.

The estimated cost of damage to agriculture due to Agaton was pegged at P186,632,976.31 which were incurred in Western Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao (Region 10), Soccsksargen (Region 12), and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

A resourceful Filipino boy incredibly survived a landslide by taking refuge in a refrigerator for a whole day in what authorities are calling an “absolute miracle.” A video of his unconventional life preserver is currently blowing up online.

The 11-year-old youth, named CJ Jasme, had been at home with his family when a massive mudslide triggered by tropical storm Megi inundated their house in Baybay City, Philippines, on Friday, Viral Press reported.

With the debris encroaching on his home, the quick-thinking Jasme hopped in the family refrigerator a la Indiana Jones escaping a nuclear explosion in “The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”

He then spent the next 20 hours hunkered down inside his improvised storm shelter.

Salvation finally came after police officer Jonas Etis spotted the refrigerator refugee on a river bank, whereupon he sent out an SOS — as another wave of rocks was inbound.

Rescue crews subsequently arrived and evacuated the survivor. Accompanying footage shows the first responders hoisting the ice box-bound boy out of the mud like a coffin, and then transferring him onto a makeshift stretcher.

Rescuers said the first words the child spoke to them were, “I’m hungry.”

Miraculously, Jasme was still conscious and only suffered a broken leg during the ordeal.

The boy was subsequently administered first aid and ferried to the hospital, where he underwent an operation for his broken leg. He is currently in stable condition.

Alas, the youngster’s family wasn’t as lucky: Jasme’s mother and younger sibling are still missing, while his father perished in another landslide that had ravaged the community a day prior. Fortunately, his 13-year-old brother is believed to have escaped the disaster as well.

Jasme is one of many children who were orphaned following the storm, which reportedly killed at least 172 people and displaced more than two million.

Meanwhile, nearly 200 villagers were reported injured in Baybay alone over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing people.

City Councilor Mark Unlu-cay said as of Monday morning, search and retrieval operations are ongoing for the individuals that might have been trapped in their houses when the landslide occurred around midnight.

Houses have been covered in mud while the heavy downpour rendered rescue efforts difficult.

“We fear with the multiple landslides reported because the typhoon is not yet over,” Unlu-cay said.

He said they are still validating reports of multiple landslides in Brgy. Gacat, Mailhi, Kantagnos, Bubon, Villa Sol, and Amguhan.

The country's meteorologists forecasted more ""extreme"" rains on the way Tuesday night accompanied by ""widespread flooding"".

""Many people lost their lives with Ethekwini (Durban metro) alone reporting 45 so far,"" while in iLembe district ""more than 14 are reported to have tragically lost their lives,"" the provincial government said in a statement.

It said the disaster ""wreaked untold havoc and unleashed massive damage to lives and infrastructure"" affecting all races and social classes from rural areas, townships to luxury estates.

President Cyril Ramaphosa is due to visit the affected area on Wednesday.

""This is a tragic toll of the force of nature and this situation calls for an effective response by government,"" said Ramaphosa.

Days of driving rain flooded several areas, tore houses apart and ravaged infrastructure across the southeastern city, while landslides forced train services to be suspended.

The rains have flooded city highways to such depths that only the tops of traffic lights poked out, resembling submarine periscopes.

Torrents tore several bridges apart, submerged cars and collapsed houses. A fuel tank was floating in the sea after being tossed off the road.

Several stacked shipping containers fell like dominoes and lay strewn on a yard, while some spilled over into a main road in the city, one of southern Africa's largest regional gateways to the sea.

Global shipping firm Maersk suspended its operations in Durban on Tuesday due to the floods.

""At around 3:00 am (0100 GMT), I felt the truck shaking and I thought maybe someone bumped it and when I tried to open the curtain I saw the water level... was very high,"" said truck driver Mthunzi Ngcobo.

Trapped students and teachers airlifted to safety

The disaster management department in KwaZulu-Natal province, of which Durban is the largest city, urged people to stay at home and ordered those residing in low-lying areas to move to higher ground.

More than 2,000 houses and 4,000 ""informal"" homes, or shacks, have been damaged, provincial premier Sihle Zikalala, told journalists.

Rescue operations, aided by the military, are underway to evacuate people trapped in affected areas.

Fifty-two secondary students and teachers who were marooned at a Durban secondary school, were successfully airlifted to safety following ""a long traumatic night, trapped"", education authorities said.

More than 140 schools have been affected by the flooding.

Durban mayor Mxolisi Kaunda earlier said that power stations had been flooded and water supplies disrupted -- and that even graveyards had not been spared the devastation.

The city had only just recovered from deadly riots last July in which shopping malls were looted and warehouses set on fire, in South Africa's worst unrest since the end of apartheid.

There have been reports of looting, with TV footage showing people stealing from cargo containers.

The provincial government condemned ""reports of the looting of containers"" during the flooding, calling on police to ensure that property was protected.

'Climate change getting worse'

Southern parts of the continent's most industrialised country are bearing the brunt of climate change -- suffering recurrent and worsening torrential rains and flooding.

Floods killed around 70 people in April 2019.

""We know it's climate change getting worse, it's moved from 2017 with extreme storms to supposedly having record floods in 2019, and now 2022 clearly exceeding that,"" University of Johannesburg development studies professor Mary Galvin said.

""Droughts and floods will become more frequent and more intense and that's what we are seeing"" she said, frustrated at government's lack of preparedness.

""It's not surprising, it's absolutely devastating but equally devastating is the fact that we haven't done anything to get ready for it,"" she lamented.

The South African Weather Service admitted that ""the exceptionally heavy rainfall overnight (Monday) and (Tuesday) morning exceeded even the expectations of the southern African meteorological community at large"".

Rio de Janeiro has been hit by inclement weather over the past few weeks. Landslides and flooding in February killed some 240 people in the Petropolis area, in the hills above Rio de Janeiro, authorities said on March 23.

“We have more than 70 homeless families. We are providing shelters and renting hostels for these people,” Luciano Vidal, the mayor of Paraty, told Reuters.

He said mudslides blocked streets and isolated parts of the city, and entire neighborhoods were without electricity in the colonial coastal town that is a tourist attraction.

In one day, Paraty received 322 millimeter (12.68 inches) of rain, the rainfall average for six months. At least seven people died there, Vidal said. The civil defense statement only confirmed five deaths in Paraty.

The town, a tourist destination, declared a state of emergency as more rains were forecast.

In nearby Angra dos Reis, also a tourist destination hit by heavy rainfall, at least sixpeople died, the latest state tally showed.

Both the SUV and the Twitter user, who was filming the drive out of Yellowstone, had been heading towards the northern gate by Gardiner -- a Montana town badly affected by the water levels.

Only one road out of the tourist town remains open, according to Mike Skelton, the president of the local chamber of commerce.

He told KULR-8 news on Wednesday: “As you know being down here, there were several thousand visitors that were stuck here in Gardiner and couldn’t get out through the park, couldn’t get out through Highway 89”.

Roughly 10,000 people have been evacuated from Yellowstone since Sunday as floodwaters submerged critical bits of infrastructure and popular trails. Only a group of campers remains, officials said.

Residents of neighbouring towns have meanwhile taken-in thousands of visitors and power supplies continue to be affected, as does drinking water. A number of homes and buildings have also been damaged but no fatalities have been reported.

Some 87 people have been rescued by the Montana National Guard following the declaration of a disaster by state governor Greg Gianforte, the agency said on Wednesday.

Water levels in some parts are falling but according to the National Weather Service in Billings, Montana, the flood remains at the highest warning level, of 16ft.

The closures come as Yellowstone was gearing up to celebrate its 150th anniversary year, and as local communities heavily dependent on tourism were counting on a rebound following COVID-19 travel restrictions over the past two summers.

All five park entrances were closed to inbound traffic for the first summer since a series of devastating wildfires in 1988. The National Park Service said it was working to evacuate visitors and staff remaining at various locations, especially in the hardest-hit northern flank of Yellowstone.

""It is likely that the northern loop will be closed for a substantial amount of time,"" the park superintendent, Cam Sholly, said in a statement.

The ""gateway"" community of Gardiner, Montana, just beyond the park's northern boundary and home to many of Yellowstone's workers, was cut off by a mudslide to the north and washed-out road surfaces to the south, according to the National Park Service.

Aerial footage released by the Park Service showed large swaths of the winding North Entrance Road between Gardiner and park headquarters in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, carved away by surging floodwaters along the Gardner River - washouts that will likely take months to fully repair.

Power outages were scattered throughout the park, and preliminary assessments showed numerous roadways across Yellowstone either washed away or covered in rocks and mud, with a number of bridges also damaged, the agency said.

Various roads in the park's southern region were on the verge of being flooded, with more rain in the forecast.

The flooding and slides were triggered by days of torrential showers in the park and steady rains across much of the wider Intermountain West following one of the region's wettest springs in many years. The park service characterized the rainfall and floods sweeping the park as unprecedented, with the Yellowstone River topping its banks beyond record levels.

A sudden spike in summer temperatures during the past three days also has hastened melting and runoff of snow accumulated in the park's higher elevations from late-winter storms.

The heavy rains and rapid runoff of snow melt converged to create treacherous conditions in the park just two weeks after the traditional Memorial Day holiday weekend kickoff of the U.S. summer tourist season, which accounts of the bulk of Yellowstone's annual 4 million visitors.

Yellowstone, established as the world's first national park in 1872 and treasured as one of America's top outdoor travel destinations, occupies some 2.2 million acres (890,308 hectares)famed for its geysers, abundant wildlife and spectacular scenery.

Helena, Mon. (NEXSTAR) —On Monday, a deluge wiped out at least one bridge, washed away roads, and caused a landslide in Yellowstone National Park.

Authorities closed all five entrances, began evacuating visitors from the northern part of the park, and warned that the park was temporarily closed due to a “very dangerous situation.”

Park officials said roads to and from the Gardiner community in Montana, just north of the park, were impassable. Kam Sholy said the loop on the north side of the park could be closed for quite some time.

Park officials planned to evacuate visitors from the park’s South Loop on Monday afternoon. This is because more rain is expected.

Higher levels of flood forecasts prompted the decision, along with concerns about water and wastewater, according to Shory.

Video footage released the National Parks Service (NPS) shows the northern entrance road to the park from Gardiner, Montana destroyed as water rushes through the canyon.

Communities outside of Yellowstone like Gardiner have been isolated, as roads going in and out of town are rendered impassible.

One family staying in the area in a rental home told CNN they were stranded.

“The water levels were high on Saturday but within the past 10-12 hours things have gotten rougher,” said Parker Manning, who was visiting from Indiana.

Water levels on the Yellowstone River in Corwin Springs, Montana had blown past its previous record high by at least two feet, according to the US Geological Survey. Other rivers in the area were also far above normal levels.

Power is out in some parts of the popular natural park.

It is unclear when the park could re-open.

“We will not know timing of the park’s reopening until flood waters subside and we’re able to assess the damage throughout the park,” Mr Sholly said in the statement. “It is likely that the northern loop will be closed for a substantial amount of time.”

The flooding was caused by intense rainfall, coupled with increased snowmelt. The AP reports that the park saw 2.5 inches of rain fall from Saturday to Monday, with areas nearby recording up to four inches.

In addition, recent warmer temperatures have spurred increased snowmelt in the area, adding even more water to the landscape.

The park is one of the most popular outdoor recreation spots in the US, receiving more than 800,000 visitors a year on average.

The climate crisis is expected to bring significant change to the Yellowstone ecosystem, NPS says. In particular, warmer temperatures will likely bring decreased snowpack and a higher chance of wildfires.

Climate change may also bring more severe storms across the country. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, more rain is now coming during intense rainstorms than in years prior — which could lead to more flash flooding events.

A recent study found that floods in the US would get “flashier” as the climate warms further, leading to quicker, more intense flooding events.",mudslide at Corwin Springs,mudslide,continuous_rain,Corwin Springs,45.112340000000074,-110.78961999999996,2022-06-11 00:00:00,2022-06-11 23:59:59,1km,2022-06-11 11:59,12hours,

Alejando Murat said rivers overflowed their banks and swept away people in homes, while other victims were buried under mud and rocks.

“There were fundamentally two reasons” for the deaths, Murat told local media. “There were rivers that overflowed, and on the other hand, and the most serious part, were landslides.”

Murat said the deaths appeared to be concentrated in a number of small towns in the mountains, just inland from the coast. But he said there were also reports of three children missing near the resort of Huatulco.

Agatha made history as the strongest hurricane ever recorded to come ashore in May during the eastern Pacific hurricane season.

It made landfall on Monday afternoon on a sparsely populated stretch of small beach towns and fishing villages in Oaxaca.

It was a strong Category 2 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 105mph, but it quickly lost power moving inland over the mountainous interior. Remnants of Agatha were moving north-east on Tuesday into Veracruz state.

Murat said power had been restored to some communities near the coast, but that some bridges had been washed out and mudslides blocked a number of highways. San Isidro del Palmar, only a couple miles inland from the coast, was swamped by the Tonameca river that flows through town.

Residents waded through neck-deep water to salvage what items they could from their homes, walking gingerly with piles of clothing atop their heads and religious figures in their arms.

Argeo Aquino, who has lived in the town his whole life, said he could recall only two other occasions when he saw such flooding. “The houses are totally flooded, so they are getting everything out,” Aquino said Monday as he watched his neighbours. “There are stores, houses. More than anything else, we have to try to save all the good material, because everything else is going to be washed away.”

The Tonameca’s brown waters reached the windows of parked cars and the minibuses used for local transportation.

Nearby, heavy rain and high winds lashed the beach town of Zipolite, known for its clothing-optional beach and bohemian vibe. The wind howled for about six hours on Monday, said Silvia Ranfagni, manager of the Casa Kalmar hotel in Zipolite.

“The sound of the wind was really loud, high-pitched,” said Ranfagni. “It started at 1pm when the telephone coverage went out and it didn’t calm down until 7.30. A lot of trees were down, roads washed out. A lot of metal and thatched roofs were blown off.”",mudslide at Oaxaca,mudslide,tropical_cyclone,Oaxaca,17.06173000000007,-96.72609999999997,2022-05-30 12:00:00,2022-05-30 17:00:00,9km,2022-05-30 14:30,2hours,3

Alana Davis was recording footage on TikTok from a beach along the Douglas Highway on April 6 when the rockslide happened.

Video shows her interrupted mid-sentence by a crashing noise. She immediately grabs her camera and runs for safety, waving her arms and shouting at highway traffic to stop.

“Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop your car!” she yelled while trying to catch her breath.

Davis said a man driving a pickup was about to encounter a blind turn on the highway while traveling at 50 mph.

“Literally 30 seconds from getting killed. Think about that,” the man told Davis.

“I ran screaming down the road, just so you know, on the beach flailing my arms,” she replied.

Landslide and debris flow warning signs include a faint rumbling sound that increases in volume and is noticeable as the landslide nears, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Unusual sounds, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together, might indicate moving debris.

Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities spokesman Sam Dapcevich said about 500 cubic yards of material fell to the road from a cliff about 500 feet up the hillside near mile 11 of North Douglas Highway on April 6. Crews immediately responded and cleaned up the slide debris to reopen the highway.

On April 10, a second slide took place at the same location with approximately twice the quantity of material reaching the road, including several car-sized boulders that bounced across the road and over the guardrail, finally landing on the beach or in the water.

“Our maintenance and operations foreman was there working on cleanup when the second slide came down, and he took action to keep traffic from passing through,” Dapcevich said.

As of Wednesday, both lanes are cleared, but the road will remain closed while geologists monitor the site. A geotechnical team is gathering imagery with a drone as weather conditions allow.

“It was very windy during both slide events, many tree roots are now exposed that appear to have grown in the rock crevices. The wind moving the trees likely jostled the rock and could have been the cause of both slides. There’s still a lot of rock up there that could come down in the future,” Dapcevich said.

All entrances to Yellowstone National Park were closed Monday and would be through at least Wednesday as heavy rain falling on melting snow caused significant flooding and road damage, park officials announced.

Calling it “extremely hazardous conditions,” authorities evacuated the northern portion of the park due to flooding, rockslides and mudslides caused by record rainfall.

Park officials announced on Monday afternoon that the park would be closed to visitors until at least Wednesday.

“Red Lodge, Montana, is a river right now and we have some flooding on the west of Cody,” Cody Beers, a Wyoming Department of Transportation spokesman, told Cowboy State Daily. “I’ve never heard of Yellowstone closing the entire park to inbound traffic, though.”

Footage from the storms showed roads collapsing into raging rivers and logs piled high on the shores.

The electricity was out in several areas of the park as of Monday morning.

All inbound traffic to the park was halted until conditions stabilized and park officials could assess damage to the roads, bridges and other facilities. The visitors turned away included those with lodging and camping reservations.

Many of the park roads could be closed for an extended period of time, according to park officials.

“It’s just been multiple days of rain up in this area, plus we had snow on Memorial Day weekend,” Beers said. “It’s a rare day when we have water levels that reached the bottom of our bridges.”

Cowboy State Daily meteorologist Don Day said flood advisories surround Yellowstone because of the “huge amount of snow” coupled with the significant rain.

“I don’t think anyone thought the runoff would be as big as this,” he said.

Beers said WYDOT will continue to monitor the weather events in the northwestern portion of the state and how they might affect roads.

He recommended anyone traveling toward Yellowstone wait a day or two for officials to figure out how long certain roads will be closed and whether the rainfall in the area will continue.

“Be careful out there, because Mother Nature’s fury is showing itself right now,” Beers said.

Yellowstone superintendent Cam Sholly said on Monday that staff’s first priority was to evacuate the northern section of the park, where there were multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues.

“The community of Gardiner is currently isolated, and we are working with the county and State of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas,” Sholly said. “Due to predictions of higher flood levels in areas of the park’s southern loop, in addition to concerns with water and wastewater systems, we will begin to move visitors in the southern loop out of the park later today in coordination with our in-park business partners.”

Sholly said it was likely the northern loop of the park would be closed for a substantial amount of time.

“I appreciate the efforts of the Yellowstone team and partners to safely evacuate areas of the park and of our gateway community partners who are helping us through this major event,” he said. “We appreciate the support offered by the Department of Interior, National Park Service and the Montana and Wyoming governors.”

Teeming with world-class granite, Rocky Mountain National Park is a beloved destination by the climbing community. On June 28 at approximately 4:30 p.m., a rockslide rumbled down the south side of Hallett Peak, sliding into the Upper Upper Chaos Canyon area.

“We’ve never seen this much rock fall. We probably never will again in our lifetime,” says Jeremy Fullerton, a Front Range climber who witnessed the historic rockslide. “The towers just started collapsing and rolling towards us. The whole hillside turned into mud, and the snow from the permafrost was turning it into a river. At that moment, we started to run.”

No injuries were reported. A day later, via an update on their social media accounts, the Rocky Mountain National Park Service closed all areas in Chaos Canyon west of Lake Haiyaha citing more possible rockfall activity from the forecasted rain.

Alongside Fullerton, Front Range climbers William Mondragon, Mike Vice and Levi Van Weddingen were bouldering in the Upper Upper Chaos area near the Colossal Boulder. The Upper Upper Chaos area was first explored by Jim Belcer, Paul Otis, and Jon Linhart in 2003, and developed more extensively in 2010 by guidebook author Jamie Emerson and climbers Colin Horvat, Jimmy Webb, and Justin Jaeger. It’s home to world-class lines such as Full Chaos (V8), Lonely Mountain (V9), Wheel of Chaos (V14), and a myriad of five-star problems across the grade spectrum. Fullerton was projecting Way Down There, an unsent low start to Way Down Inside (V9), when the rockslide occurred.

Fullerton says he knew something was wrong when his friends began yelling louder and louder. “Normally your friends stay pretty quiet,” he says, “so you can focus on the boulder.” The trio had been hearing minor rockfalls all day, but this time they ran. “I have never run so fast in climbing shoes,” says Fullerton.

The group scrambled as fast as they could across the talus field, stopping 60 feet west of their location as the rockfall subsided. There, they debated whether or not to retrieve their gear. None of them had shoes, jackets, or car keys. While Fullerton kept watch, Mondragon and Levi clambered back into the cave where Fullerton was just climbing. After tossing backpacks, jackets, and gear back out, Mondragon heard Fullerton give a loud warning, “you guys need to run, now!”

Looking out from inside the cave, Mondragon saw a plume of dust billowing across and bits of rock flying through the air. For a split second, he considered staying in the cave. “It was so big and catastrophic, I [thought I] might not be able to escape either way,” Mondragon says, “I mean, you can’t really outrun a mountain.” But in a split-second decision, he ran again.

Less than a minute after Fullerton yelled his warning, he watched as the south side of Hallett Peak broke off. “It was an apartment-sized rockface coming loose,” says Fullerton, “I started yelling to direct my friends down the canyon.”

Luckily, all safely escaped the crashing debris. Looking back on the day, Fullerton acknowledged that it was not wise to return for their gear. “It’s best to be on the safe side and bail,” he says, “we were lucky.” Witnessing such a monumental rockslide will not deter him from returning. “I just love being up there so much, once it opens back up I plan on returning to Chaos Canyon.”

Rockslides and falls are synonymous with steep mountainous terrain with a freeze-thaw cycle. Dr. Alan Lee, a Geologist at the University of Colorado says, “The reason that the boulders are there is because rockslides happened thousands of years ago.” Lee recalls climbing the Northcutt-Carter route on Hallett Peak, only to return a year later to find the entire route had slid off.

With this latest slide, the boulder field of Upper Upper Chaos has been changed drastically—classic lines on the Colossal Boulder are buried. The boulders directly below the south side of Hallett Peak like Tarzan and the Brown 45 are likely buried or altered beyond recognition as well. The conditions of Full Chaos are currently unknown. Other climbers hearing of the rockfall made jokes about how Mother Nature decided to reset the area like Routesetters at a gym, but Hayden Miller, a Geologist at Los Almos National Laboratory, New Mexico says “after a rockslide, the area will remain unstable in freeze-thaw cycles for years to come.” Miller adds that rockslides are generally not predictable, but do happen in warmer parts of the year with wide temperature swings.

Due to forecasted rain, area closures will remain in effect at least until July 3. Visitors to other parts of the Park should remain vigilant as well. (Photo: William Mondragon)

There were no injuries in the slide, she said.

Engineers arrived later Thursday to begin assessing the slide area. The dock remains closed to passenger and vehicle traffic.

The agency also reported deaths in the southern Davao region, Mindanao and in the central Negros Orientals province.

Many people fled their homes to shelters or higher ground when the storm, known locally as Agaton, hit the archipelago with winds of up to 65km/h (40mph).

It was the first such storm of the year – the Philippines typically sees an average of 20 each year.

It comes about four months after Super Typhoon Rai devastated many of the nation’s south-east islands in December – killing at least 375 people and affecting about 500,000 people.

“I gathered my children in our house in Brgy. Maypatag (Ambuhan) from our other house in the barrio in preparation for my birthday. I was supposed to slaughter a pig for the celebration. We were happy before this happened,” recalled Mejia.

He said they were awakened by a loud rumbling noise around 3 a.m. on Monday (April 11) in what turned out to be an experience so tragic and so painful.

“When my wife and son got up, we were blown away by the mud coming from the mountain,” he recalled.

One of his sons was saved when he covered himself under their refrigerator that leaned to the wall.

“I heard my children crying for help. I told my son to call for help while I dug through the mud to save them,” he narrated.

He said that because of the landslide, it took time before the villagers came to help him rescue his children.

“At first I could hear one of them calling for help (Tabang) for about 20 minutes. I tried digging with my bare hands with no light until her voice stopped, then another one cried for help,” he narrated.

Remigio was able to save one of them. However, his 16-year-old daughter and 8-year-old granddaughter were already dead when they found them. That broke his heart.

He said the village chief of Brgy. Imelda was kind enough to allow them to have the vigil in the Brgy. Hall, and let them sleep there together with the families of the other victims.

Meanwhile, Mantesa Polvera and her sister Karen Joy, who both came home from Luzon could also not believe that their whole family was buried alive in the landslide in Brgy. Mailhi.

While they were attending the wake of their mother, three siblings, and two nieces, they found out that their father’s body has been recovered from the rubble.

Their uncle and one other relative remain missing.

Aside from grieving the loss of their loved ones, Mantesa and her siblings are having trouble finding the money for the burial of their family members who perished.

They were grateful for Bernandino Tacoy of BGT Cares Foundation who arrived from a relief operation to the evacuees and extended burial assistance to them.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The death toll from landslides and floods that hit the central and southern Philippines after a summer tropical depression unleashed days of pounding rain has risen to at least 43, with 28 others missing, officials said Tuesday.

More than 100 villagers were injured in landslides in the hard-hit city of Baybay in central Leyte province over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing villagers.

“We are saddened by this dreadful incident that caused an unfortunate loss of lives and destruction of properties,” said army brigade commander Col. Noel Vestuir, who was helping oversee the search and rescue.

Thirty-six of the dead were recovered from the landslides that hit six Baybay villages, military and local officials said. Seven other people drowned in floodwaters in the central provinces of Samar and Negros Oriental and southern Davao de Oro and Davao Oriental provinces.

More rescuers and heavy equipment, including backhoes, arrived in the landslide-hit villages in Baybay, but continuing rain and muddy ground have hampered the efforts. “The challenge is, it’s continuing to rain and we cannot immediately clear the landslide areas,” Vestuir said.

Coast guard, police and firefighters rescued some villagers Monday in flooded central communities, including some who were trapped on their roofs.

Scores of people are still missing and feared dead after the strongest storm to strike the archipelago nation this year dumped heavy rain over several days, forcing tens of thousands into evacuation centers.

In the central province of Leyte — the worst affected by Agaton — devastating landslides smashed farming and fishing communities, wiping out houses and transforming the landscape.

The disaster-prone region is regularly ravaged by storms — including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013 — with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of human-driven climate change.

Emergency personnel in Abuyog municipality have retrieved dozens of bodies from a coastal village destroyed by a landslide on Tuesday.

At least 26 people were killed and around 150 are missing, authorities said, with little hope of finding anyone else alive.

Many of those who died had hiked up the mountain to avoid flash floods, villagers told AFP.

“It sounded like a helicopter,” said Pilar councilor Anacleta Canuto, 44, describing the noise made by the landslide.

Canuto and her husband and their two children survived, but they lost at least nine relatives.

Pilar fisherman Santiago Dahonog, 38, said he rushed into the sea with two siblings and a nephew as the landslide hurtled towards them.

“We got out of the house, ran to the water and started swimming,” he told AFP. “I was the only survivor.”

Another 86 people were killed and dozens injured in vegetable, rice and coconut-growing villages around Baybay City last weekend, local authorities said. At least 117 are still missing.

The hardest hit was Kantagnos where 32 people died and 103 have not been found.

In the nearby village of Bunga, 17 people perished when a wave of sodden soil swept down a hill and slammed into the riverside community. Only a few rooftops are visible in the mud.

Three people also drowned on the main southern island of Mindanao, the national disaster agency said in its latest update.

Another three deaths previously reported in the central province of Negros Oriental were dropped from the tally after they were found to be unrelated to the storm.

Agaton came four months after a super typhoon devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi – the strongest to hit the disaster-prone archipelago this year – were in the central province of Leyte where a series of landslides devastated communities.

At least 47 people died and 27 were missing after waves of sodden soil smashed into farming settlements around Baybay City over the weekend, local authorities said. Just over 100 people were injured.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Search operations for survivors in Pilar village – part of Abuyog municipality in Leyte – resumed at first light Wednesday, with boats carrying rescuers to the coastal community of around 400 people a day after a landslide pushed most houses into the sea.

“We have five casualties, one unidentified,” Captain James Mark Ruiz of Abuyog police told AFP.

Around 50 survivors have been rescued from the village, the Bureau of Fire Protection said on Facebook Tuesday.

Raymark Lasco, a radio operator at the Abuyog disaster agency, told AFP that “many people” had died.

“I can’t give you exact details... because our operation is ongoing,” he said.

Port operations suspended

Search operations have also resumed around Baybay City after the rain stopped, enabling emergency personnel to access hard-hit areas, Mayor Jose Carlos Cari told CNN Philippines.

“In some barangays (villages), we’re just doing retrieval,” Cari said.

Rescuers have been using their bare hands and shovels to reach victims buried by the landslides.

A Philippine Coast Guard video shared on Facebook Tuesday showed rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher from one of the devastated villages, while other victims were piggybacked to safety.

The military has joined coast guard, police and fire protection personnel in the search and rescue efforts, which have been hampered by bad weather.

Whipping up seas, Megi forced dozens of ports to suspend operations and stranded thousands of people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year in the Philippines.

Megi came four months after super typhoon Rai devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Scientists have long warned that typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the planet becomes warmer due to climate change.

The Philippines – ranked among the most vulnerable nations to its impacts – is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

As search and rescue efforts increased with the arrival of equipment, the death toll has risen to at least 56, with 28 others missing, after a summer tropical depression that unleashed days of pounding rain caused landslides and floods in the central and southern Philippines, officials said Wednesday.

Nearly 200 villagers were injured mostly in the landslides in the hard-hit city of Baybay in central Leyte province over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing villagers.

More rescuers and heavy equipment, including backhoes, arrived in the landslide-hit villages in Baybay. Its mayor, Jose Carlos Cari, said the weather cleared Wednesday, allowing the search and rescue work to go full force.

""We're looking for so many more missing people,"" Cari said and added that authorities would do a recount to determine how many villagers were really missing and believed buried in the landslides.

Forty-seven of the dead were recovered from the landslides that hit six Baybay villages, military and local officials said. Nine other people drowned elsewhere in floodwaters in four central and southern provinces, they said.

""We are saddened by this dreadful incident that caused an unfortunate loss of lives and destruction of properties,"" said army brigade commander Col. Noel Vestuir, who was helping oversee the search and rescue.

Coast guard, police and firefighters rescued some villagers Monday in flooded central communities, including some who were trapped on their roofs.

Rescuers hampered by mud and rain on Tuesday used their bare hands and shovels to search for survivors of landslides that smashed into villages in the central Philippines, as the death toll from tropical storm Agaton rose to 42.

More than 17,000 people fled their homes as the storm pummeled the disaster-prone region in recent days, flooding houses, severing roads and knocking out power.

At least 36 people died and 26 were missing after landslides slammed into multiple villages around Baybay City in Leyte province – the hardest hit by the storm – local authorities said. Just over 100 people were injured.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Most of the deaths in Leyte were in the mountainous village of Mailhi where 14 bodies were found, Army Captain Kaharudin Cadil told AFP.

“It was a mudflash that buried houses. We recovered most of the bodies embedded in the mud,” said Cadil, spokesman for the 802nd Infantry Brigade.

Drone footage showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga, another community devastated by the storm.

At least seven people had been killed and 20 villagers were missing in Bunga, which was reduced to a few rooftops poking through the mud.

“It’s supposed to be the dry season but maybe climate change has upended that,” said Marissa Miguel Cano, public information officer for Baybay City, where 10 villages have been affected by landslides.

Cano said the hilly region of corn, rice and coconut farms was prone to landslides, but they were usually small and not fatal.

Apple Sheena Bayno was forced to flee after her house in Baybay City flooded. She said her family was still recovering from a super typhoon in December.

“We’re still fixing our house and yet it’s being hit again so I was getting anxious,” she told AFP.

Rescue efforts were also focused on the nearby village of Kantagnos, which an official said had been hit by two landslides.

“There was a small landslide and some people were able to run to safety, and then a big one followed which covered the entire village,” Baybay City Mayor Jose Carlos Cari told local broadcaster DZMM Teleradyo.

Some residents managed to escape or were pulled out of the mud alive, but many are still feared trapped.

A Philippine Coast Guard video on Facebook showed six rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher.

Other victims have been piggybacked to safety.

Four people have been confirmed dead in Kantagnos, but it is not clear how many are still missing.

“We’re looking for many people, there are 210 households there,” said the Baybay City mayor.

The military has joined coast guard, police and fire protection personnel in the search and rescue efforts.

But bad weather has hampered the response. The search was suspended late in the afternoon as it was “too dangerous” to continue in the dark, Cano said.

National disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal said landslides around Baybay City had reached settlements “outside the danger zone”, catching many residents by surprise.

“There were people in their homes that were hit directly by the landslide,” Timbal told AFP.

Agaton is the first major storm to hit the country this year.

The Philippines – ranked among the most vulnerable nations to its impacts – is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi—the strongest to hit the archipelago this year—were in the central province of Leyte, where a series of landslides devastated communities.

Twenty-six people died and around 150 were missing in the coastal village of Pilar, which is part of Abuyog municipality after a torrent of mud and earth on Tuesday pushed houses into the sea and buried most of the settlement, authorities said.

“I have to be honest, we are no longer expecting survivors,” Abuyog Mayor Lemuel Traya told AFP, adding that emergency personnel were now focused on the difficult task of retrieving bodies.

About 250 people were in evacuation centres after being rescued by boat after roads were cut by landslides, he said.

A number of villagers were also in hospital.

A rumbling sound like “a helicopter” alerted Ara Mae Canuto, 22, to the landslide hurtling towards her family’s home in Pilar.

She said she tried to outrun it, but was swept into the water and nearly drowned.

“I swallowed dirt, and my ears and nose are full of mud,” Canuto told AFP by telephone from her hospital bed. Her father died and her mother has not been found.

The disaster-prone region is regularly ravaged by storms—including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013—with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of human-driven climate change.

Baybay City is also reeling after waves of sodden soil smashed into farming settlements over the weekend, killing at least 48 people and injuring over 100, local authorities said. Twenty-seven are still missing, they added.

Aerial photos showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga village, where only a few rooftops poked through the now-transformed landscape.

“We were told to be on alert because a storm was coming, but they did not directly tell us we needed to evacuate,” said Bunga farmworker Loderica Portarcos, 47, who lost 17 relatives and a friend in the landslide.

Portarcos braved heat and humidity as she advised a backhoe operator where to dig for three bodies still embedded in the soft soil which had started to smell of rotting flesh.

“Our dead relatives are all in the morgue, but there will be no time for a wake to mourn them because the mayor told us they smell bad,” she said.

‘Many of us died’

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

The death toll from Megi is expected to rise as rescue operations switch to recovering bodies.

Black body bags containing 26 victims from Pilar were laid out on sand in Abuyog for relatives to identify on Wednesday.

Abuyog police chief Captain James Mark Ruiz said more boats were needed. But getting access to the shore was difficult.

Photos posted by the Bureau of Fire Protection on Facebook showed buildings crushed or turned over by the force of the landslide and debris in the water.

“We’re using fiber glass boats and there are steel bars exposed in the sea so it’s very difficult,” Abuyog Mayor Traya said, adding that the ground was unstable and “very risky”.

While Pilar survivor Canuto counts herself lucky to be alive, she said “many of us died and a lot are missing too”.

Whipping up seas, Megi forced dozens of ports to temporarily suspend operations, stranding thousands of people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year in the Philippines.

The landslide in November 2018 created a five-metre waterfall on the river north of Lillooet, and made it nearly impossible for migrating salmon to reach their spawning grounds.

Jeremy Venditti, principal investigator on the project, said his team of scientists will map the topography in the area using a laser to identify between 20 and 100 possible slide sites along the river.

“We’re looking for sites that might be sort of an imminent threat, or where an imminent slide may happen, and then we’ll also be identifying locations where they could happen,” he said in an interview Thursday.

Venditti said his team set up a field site on the same location of the 2018 slide almost a decade before that, so they’ll be able to compare their findings with the 2009 data to see how the slide changed the river and how to better predict these events.

“We felt that, as geoscientists, it was time for us to go and begin investigating where in the Fraser other landslides have happened in the past, but also (where they) will happen in the future, and the effects that they have on flow in the river, fish migration and the genetics of Fraser salmon, which we think have probably been impacted now a number of times by landslides.”

Venditti said they’ll share the information with the Fisheries Department and First Nations communities, so they can prepare for potential slides and make plans to protect the salmon.

He said possible mitigation could include engineering solutions like building fishways that can help salmon get past blocked passages.

The Fisheries Department said that 85,000 cubic metres of rock fell into the river, stopping many salmon runs from migrating.

After the remote slide was discovered, fish were transported past the site using helicopters, trucks and a so-called salmon cannon until a fish ladder was built, although the department said in July that it was still looking for a more permanent solution.

The department has said the slide is a major factor in some of the worst salmon returns on record in the Fraser River.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 12, 2022.

Nearly 4,000 homes and 500 schools have been destroyed, with more than 40,000 people displaced by floods and mudslides caused by prolonged heavy rains.

The weather system that triggered the floods led to more than 300mm of rain being dumped in a 24-hour period on 11 April, equal to about 75% of South Africa’s average total annual precipitation. Further rainfall on subsequent days increased these totals by up to 150mm in regions around Durban, which exacerbated flooding problems.

The north-east of India has been experiencing an extremely wet spell through April so far, as south-westerly winds have brought persistent, pre-monsoon rainfall from the Bay of Bengal. Winds of 50-60mph have been recorded, with frequent thunderstorms and hailstorms as well. As a result, extensive damage has been reported in parts of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh, where 8,000 homes have been damaged and 14 people have died.

Additionally, a huge landslide in Arunchal Pradesh’s Kurung Kumey district on 19 April that was triggered by heavy rain has been reported to have killed nine people – with a further 21 landslips in Assam cutting off 800 villages.

Low pressure across the north-eastern US has brought winter back for many, with a spring storm bringing more than a foot of snow in places. States as far south as Virginia and Florida have seen wintry weather, but the worst of it was recorded in Virgil, in upstate New York, where 46cm (18in) of snow was reported.

Binghamton, NY set a two-day record for April with 37cm (14.5in) of snow by 19 April, with further thundersnow in Albany. Farther south, parts of west Virginia and Maryland recorded about 15cm (6in) of snow.

More than 17,000 people fled their homes as the storm pummelled the disaster-prone region in recent days, flooding houses, severing roads and knocking out power.

At least 22 people were dead and 27 missing after landslides slammed into multiple villages in Leyte province — one of the hardest hit by the storm — local authorities said. Just over 100 people were injured.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

“It’s supposed to be the dry season but maybe climate change has upended that,” said Marissa Miguel Cano, public information officer for Leyte’s Baybay City, where many of the devastated villages are located.

Drone footage shared on Facebook and verified by AFP showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga, one of the communities affected.

At least one person had been killed and 21 people were missing in the devastated village, which had been reduced to a few rooftops poking through the mud.

Cano said the hilly region of corn, rice and coconut farms was prone to landslides, but they were usually small and not fatal.

Rescue efforts were also focused on the nearby village of Kantagnos, which an official said had been hit by two landslides.

Some residents managed to escape or were pulled out of the mud alive, but many are still feared trapped.

Five people have been confirmed dead in Kantagnos, but it is not clear how many are still missing.

A Philippine Coast Guard video shared on Facebook showed six rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher to safety.

“There was a small landslide and some people were able to run to safety, and then a big one followed which covered the entire village,” Baybay City Mayor Jose Carlos Cari told local broadcaster DZMM Teleradyo.

“We’re looking for many people, there are 210 households there.”

Cari said the bad weather was hampering rescue efforts.

“We’re pushing, but we’re having a hard time because it’s dangerous,” he said.

“Equipment has been mobilized, everything is ready, but we’re unable to move because it’s still raining heavily and rivers are still swollen.”

Direct hit on homes

The military has joined coast guard, police and fire protection personnel in the search and rescue efforts.

National disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal said landslides around Baybay City had reached settlements “outside the danger zone”, catching many people by surprise.

“There were people in their homes that were hit directly by the landslide,” Timbal told AFP.

“Agaton” is the first major storm to hit the country this year.

Whipping up seas, it forced dozens of ports to suspend operations and stranded nearly 8,000 people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year.

The Philippines reopened to fully vaccinated tourists from most countries in February after lifting practically all Covid-19 restrictions, and Easter is a popular holiday for domestic tourists.

The storm comes four months after a super typhoon devastated swathes of the archipelago nation, killing more than 400 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Scientists have long warned typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer due to climate change.

Rescue workers on Wednesday located the bodies of two tourists who had been missing in the Bustillo Hotel, according to the public prosecutor’s office of the province of Rio Negro, where San Carlos de Bariloche is located.

The other person who was killed had been found hours after the mudslide that caused tons of mud to rush into the hotel on Monday afternoon following a big rainstorm. Three others were injured and remain hospitalized.

The two bodies located early Wednesday morning were on the bed in a hotel room that had been covered to the roof with mud and other debris.

“Half of the mud was removed before we could reach the people who were in the bedroom, lying down on the bed,” Patricia Díaz, subsecretary of Bariloche Civil Protection, said.

The Patagonian city of Bariloche, located some 1,500 kilometers south of Buenos Aires, is one of Argentina’s main tourist destinations.

Officials have yet to release the names of the victims.

The local prosecutor’s office is investigating the cause of the mudslide and officials will be meeting with family members of the victims and Uruguayan diplomats.

Disaster response workers, police and local villagers were trying to rescue those buried under the debris in Noney, a town near Imphal, the capital of Manipur state.

Seven of the confirmed dead were members of the Territorial Army, state chief minister N. Biren Singh said. He said five Indian Railway officials were among those feared missing.

A railway project is being constructed in the area, where there is a rebel insurgency, and the army personnel were providing security for railway officials overseeing the project. The state’s decades-old insurgency seeks a separate homeland for ethnic and tribal groups.

Continuous rainfall over the past three weeks has wreaked havoc across India’s northeast, which has eight states and 45 million people, and in neighboring Bangladesh.

An estimated total of about 200 people have been killed in heavy downpours and mudslides in states including Assam, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim, while 42 people have died in Bangladesh since May 17. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced.

Scientists say climate change is a factor behind the erratic, early rains that triggered the unprecedented floods. Monsoon rains in South Asia typically begin in June, but torrential rain lashed northeastern India and Bangladesh as early as March this year.

With rising global temperatures due to climate change, experts say the monsoon season is becoming more variable, meaning that much of the rain that would typically fall throughout the season arrives in a shorter period.

Intermittent rain continued in the region where 19 bodies have been recovered so far after a hillock caved in and buried the railroad project area, Guite told The Associated Press.

Lt. Gen. R.P. Kalita, head of the army’s eastern command, visited the site. He said 13 soldiers and five civilians have been rescued from the debris of the entirely swept away railroad station, staff residential quarters and other infrastructure that was being built.

The army also set up a medical post at the site to treat those rescued, Kalita said.

Eighteen people with injuries have been hospitalized, said Guite. He put the number of those still unaccounted for at around 50.

A flowing river has been blocked by the debris, creating a dam-like structure, he said. People living nearby have been asked to move to safe areas.

Ten of the confirmed dead were members of the Territorial Army. Because of a decades-old insurgency seeking a separate homeland for ethnic and tribal groups in the area, army personnel had been providing security for the railway officials.

Most of those carried off in the mudslide were sleeping when it hit the area early Thursday. Some survivors recalled being swept down by the gush of the hill debris, The Times of India daily cited Daichuipao, a resident, as saying.

Unfortunately, more and more keep popping up across the City of Pittsburgh.

KDKA Investigator Meghan Schiller wanted to find out how many landslides are on the city's list for monitoring and if the list is growing faster than in years past.

Only on KDKA: we took concerned residents' questions straight to Eric Setzler, the City of Pittsburgh's lead engineer.

KDKA first reported on the El Paso Street slide in Morningside on Feb. 16, but its appearance has deteriorated in the past month and a half. Setzler tells KDKA it's up next for repairs.

We interviewed concerned neighbors along El Paso Street in Morningside who tell KDKA that the mailman and delivery trucks are struggling to maneuver the narrowing roadway.

""It stopped at the bottom of my deck and the deck tipped over,"" said neighbor Collen Crnkovich.

We highlighted the disappearing Bon Air backyards along Drycove Street and talked to neighbors who fear the city will condemn their homes as their legal bills pile up.

""I have no place to go during the wintertime, during the pandemic,"" said neighbor Mary Kaye-Kienke.

State Rep. Emily Kinkead is pushing for funding to help homeowners like Kaye-Kienke stuck with high bills to repair landslides on their properties. She previously proposed House Bill 1054, hoping to create a way to help these homeowners since no home insurance will cover the cost.

""We don't have anything, like nothing exists to help people recover,"" said Kinkead.

Jersey barriers recently popped up on Andover Terrace in North Oakland. Neighbors say the street is shifting and pulling away from the sidewalk.

""I hope they're gonna fix it after all,"" said neighbor Della Pennywell.

It's a safety issue with no quick fix.

""Whoever owns the land that slides is responsible for fixing the landslide,"" said Setzler.

He admits it's not something in the budget for most homeowners.

""I mean it's hard enough for the city to have enough resources to fix these landslides, how can you expect the typical homeowner?"" he said.

But if the slide involves city property, like a street, stairs or ""right of way,"" it's his department's responsibility. He's tracking more than 100 slides right now.

""Probably in the range of 120 landslides that we're aware of and not all of those necessarily require any action,"" said Setzler. ""We have 75 that we're monitoring or keeping an eye on.""

It's expensive to do the research, complete a design and initiate the fix. Setzler tells KDKA the city's spending about $5 million each year to fix the slides.

""And honestly that's probably not enough,"" he said.

But he said it's a balancing act. The city's also paying to fix sidewalks, stairs and bridges.

Setzler tells KDKA that the residents of El Paso Street will see work begin shortly.

""It's very close to the end of the design process and we'll be putting it up to bid for construction, but that was a pretty big landslide, and it took a while to get through the design process,"" he said.",landslide at Morningside,landslide,rain,Morningside,38.82824000000005,-76.88858999999997,2022-02-16 00:00:00,2022-02-16 23:59:59,2km,2022-02-16 11:59,12hours,

GAUHATI, India (AP) — Fresh rain and falling boulders on Saturday hampered rescuers who have so far pulled out 26 bodies from the debris of a mudslide that wiped out a railroad construction site in India’s northeast, officials said.

Rescue work is expected to continue for a couple of days in rugged hilly terrain with little hope of finding survivors among 37 people still missing since Wednesday night.

Pankaj Kavidayal, a rescue official, said 21 of the confirmed 26 dead were members of the Territorial Army. Army personnel had been providing security for the railway officials because of a decades-old insurgency seeking a separate homeland for ethnic and tribal groups in the area.

More than 250 soldiers, rescuers and police using bulldozers and other equipment were involved in the operation in Noney, a town near Imphal, the capital of Manipur state. They have been cautioned about fresh mudslides reported in the region on Saturday.

Excavators were also used to search for bodies in a river.

Thirteen soldiers and five civilians have been rescued from the debris of the entirely swept away railroad station, staff residential quarters and other infrastructure that was being built, Kavidayal said. Continuous rainfall over the past three weeks has wreaked havoc across India’s northeast — eight states and 45 million people — and neighboring Bangladesh.

An estimated 200 people have been killed in heavy downpours and mudslides in states including Assam, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim, while 42 have died in Bangladesh since May 17. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced.

The order came as photos of the alleged landslide posted on social media captured the attention of netizens.

Bambalan said the agency and the Mines and Geosciences Bureau or MGB have already formed an investigating team that will go to San Agustin in Isabela to investigate the real cause of the landslide.

Initial information gathered by Bambalan revealed that a crater at the top of the mountain could have been the cause of the landslide triggered by heavy rains.

The DENR had also sought the help of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in Isabela for an aerial survey to determine if indeed there is a crater on top of the mountain.

“Maging ang tulong ng mga katutubong agta para samahan ang investigating team dahil masukal umano ang lugar,” a report from the Cagayan Provincial Information Office said.

Authorities are eager to know the exact location of the landslide to assess the incident.

“This precipitation has fallen on our mountain snowpack which has added even more water into our river systems,” said Steve Barton of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a press release.

Barton said several points throughout the basin will reach flood stage.

“Of primary concern to us at this point is public safety,” he said. “This system of dams was built primarily to protect the public from catastrophic floods. While we cannot prevent all flooding, we can take steps to minimize the impacts of these powerful weather events.”

Rising water levels in the Willamette River closed a portion of Portland’s popular multi-use path, the Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade, from the Morrison Bridge to the Steel Bridge. City officials say it could remain closed for several days. The river is expected to rise to 15.5 feet.

The Columbia River also rose over the weekend, reaching 15.6 feet by mid-Sunday. The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning along the river from Vancouver to Longview.

Flood stage in Vancouver is 16 feet (4.87 meters), and forecasters say river levels will approach that level repeatedly through late Wednesday morning. At 16 feet, minor flooding occurs, affecting islands and low-lying areas, with minor impacts on parks or trails along the river, according to the National Weather Service.

The NWS also issued a flood watch for much of northeastern Oregon through Sunday night. Officials warned people to be on the lookout for potential landslides.

Landslides can occur near steep terrain, especially near burned areas from recent wildfires, and they can move faster than a person can run.

Emergency officials are warning swimmers to stay away from local rivers in the coming days, as the rainfall could cause river swelling and rapid currents.

Firefighters in Ridgefield, Washington, rescued a man and his two daughters Saturday afternoon after their boat capsized in the Lewis River. The boat had struck a collection of trees in the river before it capsized. The man was able to hang on to his 8-year-old daughter after they were thrown into the water, but his 12-year-old daughter was sent downstream. All three were rescued from the river in stable condition. Rescue crews say the two girls were wearing flotation devices, which likely saved their lives.

Regional Executive Director Gwendolyn Bambalan of the DENR issued the statement after conducting an investigation to determine the cause of a landslide which covers an approximate average width of 90 meters and total height of 1,592 meters above sea level.

The landslide took place at Sitio Diariong, Barangay Villa Gracia, Maddela, Quirino.

“The landslide incident was a natural occurrence due to heavy rains,” stressed director Bambalan.

The investigating team was composed of personnel from the Community Environment and Natural Resources Offices of San Isidro in Isabela and Nagtipunan in Quirino and the local government units of San Agustin and Maddela towns.

Bambalan added that the area is covered with mossy forest and limestone rock formation within the Quirino Protected Landscape.

She also noted that the team discovered bedrocks and boulders along the Sili Creek found at the foot of the incident area, and discolored flowing water from the top of the landslide site.

Bambalan also noted the absence of inhabitants or community in the area and that no traces of illegal activities were found in the site and nearby areas.

The investigators spent almost a week to reach the exact location of the landslide in the mountain.

The agency has yet to ascertain the condition of the uppermost area of the mountain and determine what possibly caused the landslide incident.

The DENR together with the Mines and Geosciences Bureau has scheduled aerial surveillance in coordination with proper authorities to identify what caused the landslide.

The DENR conducted the investigation after a netizen posted on his Facebook account photos of landslide with caption ‘Mahal naming Sierra Madre, bakit may sugat ka, sana’y huwag lumala ang sugat mo. Sanay mapansin natin ito.’

Most of the victims were reserve soldiers from the Territorial Army who had been working on the railway project.

Eighteen people have so far been pulled alive from the earth with no more rescued overnight, an army statement said, while 12 reservists and 26 civilians remain missing.

The situation at the scene of the landslide was “still serious” with rainfall and bad weather hampering rescue efforts, Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh said.

India’s remote northeast has been pummeled by heavy rainfall in recent weeks, triggering landslides and floods.

Dozens were killed in the region after flooding last month, with relentless rains causing landslides and inundating homes.

Earlier this year, at least 10 people, including a four-year-old child, were killed in floods and landslides after unusually heavy rains hit several parts of India.

Experts say climate change is increasing the number of extreme weather events around the world, with damming, deforestation and development projects in India exacerbating the human toll.

As many as ten excavators are on the job to clear the path to bring the blocked river back to its natural flow.

Speaking to EastMojo, Manipur Water Resources & Disaster Management Minister Awangbow Newmai said it was after the river downstream had almost dried up that people got to learn about the landslide.

The river reportedly changed its course after a significant amount of sediment got deposited along a major portion, which is also hitting the right bank of the river and posing threat of more landslides in the same.

“Now when the river course changes towards the right bank and if the water keeps hitting the bank, the soil will slide further down and completely block the river. Our fear now is that if the river gets blocked again, there are many people downstream who will be affected,” Newmai told EastMojo.

Water on one side of the river rose significantly after it was blocked by debris due to the landslide on June 28. On Thursday, Noney district administration issued an advisory urging people to stay alert and be prepared for any assistance if the condition deteriorates.

“Obstruction in the flow of the river created a dam-like storage condition which if breached will wreak havoc to the low-lying areas of Noney,” the advisory read.

However, over 500 personnel including officials of the Indian Army, NDRF, SDRF, Manipur police and local volunteers and around 40 excavators are on the job to widen the river’s water flow together with the search and rescue operations.

Meanwhile, additional teams of NDRF from Assam have been assigned and more teams from Arunachal Pradesh have been requested.

Until Sunday, of the 80 confirmed victims at the unfortunate landslide incident at Makhuam in Noney district, the joint task force have rescued 18 persons, while 42 persons still remain untraceable. The search and rescue team, however, is continuing its operation to trace the remaining 20 missing persons.

Body identification has become increasingly difficult due to tissue deterioration. Moreover, finding missing bodies has also become difficult as our ability to trace them decreases with depth, said Noney DC Haulianlal Guite.

At the time of writing this, the death toll stands at 46, with over a dozen missing. The hill community reported that before the disaster, two engineers had warned of the possibility of landslides after examining the soil condition. There are further predictions of impending landslides, putting many lives at risk. The landslide created a dam-like barrier on river Ijai, which, when breached, could wreak havoc on the low-lying areas of the Noney District.

Manipur experiences numerous disasters due to floods and earthquakes, and the most common in the hilly regions are landslides or mudslides. The Manipur public works department (PWD), in their Disaster Management Plan of 2017, had mentioned:

ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW

“As it is a hilly state, landslides and mudslides are quite common…… Even at present, mudslides due to the construction of the Jiribam-Tupul Railway line have affected many families in Tamenglong District.”

Here, one must note that heavy rainfall on the hilly topography (of loose soil conditions) makes landslides a common phenomenon. Tamenglong and Noney districts face regular landslides. So, one can imagine the disastrous outcome of constructing railway bridges in hilly terrain: it is common sense that such an undertaking involves risk and contingencies.

A December 5 report by Deccan Herald mentioned a comment of the railway project’s chief engineer. “the northeast region is the 6th most quake-prone belt in the world, the soil of the young Himalayan region is weak and due to the heavy monsoon for a longer period, the working season is very less in the hilly region,” he said.

The highly-ambitious railway project, part of the Look East and Act East policy through the Northeast Railway Frontier (NRF) aims to connect with ASEAN countries. The 111-kilometre, Jiri- Tupul- Imphal railway connectivity is a broad-gauge railway line for freight and passenger transport that would pass through 46 tunnels, and 22 major and 129 minor bridges. The railway project has brought unwelcomed changes in the landscape and manufactured discord within the complex land ownership pattern of the hill community.

An article by Makepeace Sitlhou published in February 2020, titled ‘Ground Report: As a Railway Line Grows, a River in Manipur Is Fighting for Survival’ captures the ground reality of the community directly affected by the mega railway project.

ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW

The daily activities of the railway construction depicts the lack of social and environmental impact assessment, evident from the reckless excavation of sand and stones from the river beds to the dumping of cement and untreated chemical waste in the river. To achieve the target completion of the Jiri-Tupul- Imphal line by December 2023, the nonstop construction increased unregulated and haphazard activities without any consideration of the state of the land, forest and river.

The hill communities continued to be blamed for contributing to deforestation and the overall climate crisis (Chanu, 2017, Sophia & Devi 2020), citing Jhum cultivation as the main factor. Jhum cultivation has long been under the scrutiny of non-tribal groups and criticised time and again for causing damage, without knowledge on the living reality of the hill communities intricately linked to the natural environment. The narratives from non-tribal groups push for the elimination of Jhum cultivation, and in hindsight, are a rationale for the extension of the contentious uniform land law in the hill and the valley. Characterising the hill communities as incompetent in managing their commons (natural resources) is an outright mockery of the hill people who sustainably balance their lives with the fragile ecology.

The recent report on July 3 in the Times of India by Kangan Kalita perpetuated these narratives while arguing that Jhum cultivation enhances the possibility of landslides.

Such debates are shallow and irrelevant in the face of the disaster. The ‘woke’ talk on climate change, suggesting the hill people should plant more trees to avoid disaster, is a strategy to shift the entire blame on the hill community with no bargaining capacity against the state’s development policies while justifying the state’s undertaking.

The landslide analysis without considering social and environmental justice is fallacious. The processes that lead to the compromised position of the hill people at the cost of their lives and land must be understood foremost. The discussion on the landslide should serve as a portal to critically examine various infrastructural projects undertaken by the Government of India to espouse economic growth.

The landslide-disaster sparked opinions from netizens on various social networking sites,. Comments on communal lines based on the ‘ching -tam’ (hill- valley) dynamics of the state triggered anger, while many outpoured their grief on the loss of lives of the hill people and personnel. Nevertheless, such a tough time suggests that we must revisit the concept of justice (social and environmental), though there is no straightforward solution to the conundrum of development. We must find a way, where human lives and the environment cease to endure as collateral damages at the footstool of development projects.

City officials declared a state of emergency on Saturday and asked inhabitants of 53 homes in the borough of La Baie to evacuate before 7 a.m. Sunday.

The order came after 21 households were evacuated in the region north of Quebec City earlier this week, following a landslide that swept away an empty house on Monday.

Saguenay Mayor Julie Dufour told reporters Sunday that families forced to flee could be out of their homes for weeks or even months. She said they’d get help from the city to relocate.

“As the mayor, it warms my heart that everybody is alive,” Dufour said. “We were able to avoid a disaster.”

Officials said the ground underneath the evacuated area is unstable and it could lead to a massive landslide similar to the Saint-Jean-Vianney disaster.

Hundreds of residents of Saint-Jean-Vianney, also in the Saguenay region, were left without homes in May 1971, after a gigantic landslide swept through the community, killing 31 people.

“Right now, everything is possible,” Dufour said, warning against scaring residents with such a comparison.

“Are there going to be houses that aren’t going to be able to remain there? Homes that will stay but with stabilizing renovation? Others without? It’s too early to say.”

The priority is to evacuate as fast as possible, said Saguenay Fire Department Chief Carol Girard at a Sunday press conference.

While the risk of a landslide was “imminent,” he said more ground analysis is needed in the upcoming days to determine whether additional people need to be displaced.

Andree Laforest, Quebec municipal affairs minister, said at the same press conference that Geneviève Guilbault, the provincial public security minister, was considering whether the province would also declare a state of emergency.

In the meantime, 30 homes were made available for evacuated residents and support and accommodation services were put in place with the Red Cross, the Saguenay, and the public security ministry, Laforest added.

Camping sites have offered accommodation, along with seniors’ residences and other places might be made available in the future, she said.

“It’s a shock, but residents can see we avoided the worst.”

About 187 residents had to relocate from the La Baie district after a landslide destroyed a house last week. Dominic Arseneau, a spokesperson for the city of Saguenay, said the city declared a local state of emergency Saturday night and planned to make an official request Monday evening to the province to extend it.

The evacuated area, Arseneau said in an interview, remains unstable and other landslides are “imminent and inevitable.”

“We know it’s going to happen, we just don’t know when,” he added.

Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters Monday she was waiting on the official request from the city before signing the state of emergency order. She said the declaration would allow Saguenay to sidestep the usual paperwork and more easily requisition property, sign contracts and redirect traffic.

“We need a good reason to declare state of emergency, but it’s rare that a municipality will ask for it if they don’t need to,” Guilbault said.

Arseneau said emergency levees have been erected in the affected part of the city to avoid any more displacement and to stop debris and mud from sliding further into the area.

Several groups have offered to shelter displaced families, most of whom had a few hours to pack their belongings and didn’t know whether they would be able to return to their homes.

Marie-Chantale Tremblay says she called her mother, 57, and stepfather, 66, slightly before 10 p.m. on Saturday after seeing on social media that people were evacuating the La Baie neighbourhood.

“My mom didn’t believe it at first, but everything happened so quickly,” Tremblay said Monday in an interview. “We tried to take as much as we could … They left their home, the memories behind.”

Contact Nature, a non-profit that owns two campgrounds in La Baie, is one of the groups that have offered to provide free accommodation to the families affected by the landslides. Its CEO, Marc-André Galbrand, says that five families, including Tremblay’s, have contacted him.

“There are no words; we are devastated like everyone else by what is happening,” Galbrand said in an interview Monday. “We will do everything we can to make the transition as easy as possible.”

Meanwhile, residents were scheduled to meet on Monday with government officials about the different types of assistance programs available to people who are searching for emergency accommodation. Each person who was forced from their home will receive $20 a day for living expenses, the public security department said.

Quebec is also offering $260,000 to those who won’t be able to return to their homes, Guilbault said.

“The city of Saguenay suffered a lot in the past,” she said about the natural disasters that have hit the city. “Right now, people are very proactive because of it, but at one point, people are fed up. We will be there; we know it’s difficult.”

Didier Perret, a research scientist with Natural Resources Canada who has been studying landslides in the Saguenay area since 1996, says the region is known for its unstable clay soil. The city, Perret added, meets a lot of the criteria for landslides.

The affected district is located on a hill with a steep incline, and recent heavy rains have made the soil particularly unstable, he said.

Hundreds of residents of Saint-Jean-Vianney, Que., also in the Saguenay region, were left without homes in May 1971, after a major landslide swept through the community, killing 31 people. In 1996, the Chicoutimi River flooded, triggering landslides and causing damage that killed at least 10 people, forcing thousands from their homes.

“Those events are still remembered,” Perret said. “When landslides happen, it brings back bad memories.”

“This incident in the Sierra Madre mountain in Quirino province was not due to mining, logging or any illegal activities near or where the landslide was located,” DENR Region 2 officers stated.

DENR Region2 govt director Gwendolyn Bambalan stated the landslide — roughly 90 meters large at 1,592 meters above sea stage — passed off at Sitio Dioriong, Barangay Villa Gracia in Maddela city in Quirino.

“The incident was a natural occurrence due to heavy rains,” Bambalan defined.

A workforce from the neighborhood DENR workplaces of San Isidro city in Isabela and Nagtipunan city in Quirino and the native authorities models of San Agustin (Isabela) and Maddela (Quirino) investigated the incident.

Their discovering, as said by to the DENR Region2, confirmed that the realm is roofed with mossy forest and limestone rock formations throughout the Quirino Protected Landscape.

It stated the workforce additionally found bedrocks and boulders alongside the Sili Creek discovered on the foot of the incident space, and discolored flowing water from the highest of the landslide web site.

Bambalan stated the absence of inhabitants or neighborhood within the space with no traces of illegal activities discovered within the web site and close by areas solely exhibits that the landslide was not man-made.

She additionally stated the investigating workforce that trekked for nearly every week to succeed in the landslide's actual location discovered no activities performed within the space.

Meanwhile, the Mines and Geosciences Bureau led by Region 2 Director Mario Ancheta stated they’re additionally conducting aerial surveillance along with the DENR regional workplace in coordination with correct authorities to establish the situation of the uppermost space of the mountain.

“This way, we will be able to determine what possibly caused the landslide,” Ancheta added.

NEW DELHI: At least eight persons were killed while many others were reported missing after a massive landslide struck a camp of the Territorial Army in Manipur’s Noney district.

Thirteen others were rescued and hospitalised. The tragedy occurred in the wee hours of Thursday. The number of people missing was said to be 46.

Chief Minister N Biren Singh tweeted, “Called an emergency meeting to assess the situation of the landslide in Tupul today. The search and rescue operation is already underway. Let’s keep them in our prayers. Ambulances along with doctors have also been dispatched to assist in the operation.”



His Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma mourned the deaths and expressed condolences to the bereaved families.



Defence sources said the landslide had struck the company location of 107 Territorial Army, deployed near Tupul railway station for the protection of the under-construction railway line from Jiribam to Imphal.



“Full scale rescue operations are in progress by columns of Indian Army and Assam Rifles. Thirteen individuals have been rescued,” Nagaland’s Kohima-based defence spokesman Lt Col Sumit K Sharma said.



He said the injured were being treated at the Army medical unit in Noney. The evacuation of the critically-injured personnel is in progress. The flow of Ijai river has been affected due to the landslide, he said.

He also said that the rescue operations had been hampered by fresh landslides and bad weather.



“However, a concerted effort is underway. The Army helicopters are on standby waiting for the weather to clear,” he added. Locals said the debris obstructed the flow of Ijai and created a dam-like storage condition.

A dozen people are feared to be trapped under tons of rubble after a massive landslide hit a town in western Manipur’s Noney district. The landslide also impeded the flow of a river, creating a dam-like body of water that could lead to flooding if the debris is removed, leading to a complex environmental disaster.

Many who work on a major railway construction site are also feared to be trapped under piles of rubble, Noney District deputy commissioner Haulinlal Guite said.

The obstructed flow of the Ijei River, which has resulted in a dam-like structure, could flood low-lying areas if the situation deteriorates. The officer has asked the residents of Noney to take precautions and not allow children near the river.

The district administration liaises with state and national emergency response agencies for search, rescue and relief operations.

Residents have been asked to remain vigilant for continued rain, which could worsen the situation.

Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh held an emergency meeting.

“We have convened an emergency meeting today to assess the situation of the Tupul landslide. The search and rescue operation is already underway. Let us keep them in our prayers today. Ambulances and doctors have also been sent to assist with the operation,” Singh said. tweeted.

People have been asked to avoid National Highway-37, which runs through this area, due to multiple landslide blockades amid heavy rains in recent days.

ESTES PARK, Colo. — Officials at Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) closed Chaos Canyon after a significant rockslide event happened Tuesday afternoon.

The large rockfall event happened on the south side of Hallett Peak at around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday that resulted in sliding rock falling into Upper Chaos Canyon. Park officials said the reason for the closure is that the area around the slide is highly unstable and there are forecasted rainstorms for the area until July 3, which could trigger more rockfall activity.

The closure area covers Chaos Canyon starting on the west side of Lake Haiyaha. The trail to Lake Haiyaha and the lake itself remain open for visitors. Hiking trails on the north side of Hallett Peak are also open. The bouldering area in Lower Chaos Canyon on the north and east shore of Lake Haiyaha will also remain open.

The cause of the rockfall remains unknown, RMNP officials said Thursday. The canyon will remain closed until the forecasted storms pass and National Park Service geologists can evaluate the area.

A spokesperson for the park said visitors were reminded to always practice due diligence, especially in rocky terrain, as those areas can be unstable.

According to alltrails.com, Hallett Peak is a popular area for birding, hiking and horseback riding. The 10.3-mile out-and-back trail near Estes Park is considered a challenging route.

Several homes slid down, others were destroyed, and the condominiums below were heavily damaged.

Residents of the Laguna Niguel neighborhood, where ridgetop homes have swimming pools and panoramic views, were sure that no one would ever think of building there again.

Now, 24 years later, a developer is proposing new condominiums at the base of the hill. Improvements made since the landslide will prevent disaster from striking again, the project’s proponents say.

The developer, Barry Hon of Laguna Niguel Properties LLC, is familiar with the risk. He built the original Niguel Summit neighborhood, including the Via Estoril homes, which now sell for more than $1 million, and the condos below.

Residents fear that Hon’s new project will destabilize the hill and send it crashing down again.

“We just don’t want to have to live with that kind of fear and uncertainty and have people move in below us who might also be in danger,” said Sara Nuss-Galles, who has lived on Via Estoril since 2005.

Many also worry that officials will use the increasing demand for housing across Southern California and a requirement that the city zone for more than 1,200 new units as justification to approve the project, when there are safer places in the city to build.

“It is hard to stop development in California,” said Jim Kozel, who lives in Niguel Summit. “It’s our understanding that fighting this is going to be difficult, but we have to protect the homeowners.”

In the 1980s, Hon built about 1,500 homes, including the ones on Via Estoril, on a man-made hill about five miles from the ocean.

Years later, residents on Via Estoril began complaining about cracking walls and sagging fences. At the 41-unit condominium complex below, residents also saw cracks in their walls, and the sidewalks buckled as the earth shifted underneath. Some sued the developer, alleging faulty construction.

Carolyn Brown and her husband, Fred Brown, bought a home on Via Estoril in 1995, drawn to the cool ocean breeze and the view of the Pacific.

A year and a half later, they noticed cracks widening in their driveway and along a retaining wall. Officials determined that the slope was shifting more rapidly after El Niño storms in late 1997.

Officials soon red-tagged several homes on Via Estoril. The structures creaked and glass popped as residents rushed to pack their belongings.

“I remember walking into our bedroom, which was on the back side of the house, and there was this built-in cabinet with drawers, and all the drawers were open,” Carolyn Brown recalled recently. “I looked in the corner of the bedroom. There was a huge gap, and I realized, ‘Oh my God, the house is tilting, and that’s why these drawers have opened up.’ I immediately got out of there and never went back.”

When the hill finally gave way, it sounded like thunder. Two large two-story homes slid down and crumpled into heaps.

The Browns’ home dangled above the hillside for days before disintegrating. In all, nine homes on the ridge were destroyed.

Below, several condominium units were also destroyed, and the entire complex was demolished so the land could be graded to stabilize the area.

The developer and original builder, J.M. Peters, paid millions to the Niguel Summit Community Association as part of a legal settlement. The money was used to build a massive concrete wall with tieback anchors, a giant mass of soil called a buttress, and subdrains to move rainwater.

City officials told residents it was highly unlikely that the land would be built on again.

But the area remained zoned for homes. The city was set to receive a $5.6-million grant to purchase the land and designate it open space, until the Federal Emergency Management Agency pulled back the funding because homeowners had already been paid legal settlements.

Hon and his company are proposing 22 three-story condos on less than two acres at the bottom of the hill along Crown Valley Parkway.

The units are designed to appeal to young people, with floor plans to accommodate working from home and oversized garages that can be used for exercise equipment. Similarly-sized condominiums elsewhere in the city have recently sold for more than $600,000.

“With the city of Laguna Niguel on the edge of a generational shift, the proposed 22 townhomes are responsive to that and seek to attract a younger demographic to the city,” said Marice DePasquale, the community outreach liaison for the project.

DePasquale said the condos, called “The Cove at El Niguel,” will not be built on the landslide footprint and that neighbors’ views will not be affected.

The landslide area “has been stabilized and is suitable to accommodate the plan as currently proposed,” she said.

To provide space for yards and a retaining wall, the construction plan would involve grading the bottom edge of the soil buttress that helps stabilize the hill.

According to geotechnical experts hired by the developer, as well as a separate firm that reviewed the plans for the city, shaving off part of the buttress is safe and won’t affect the stability of the hillside.

The developer has prepared a draft environmental impact report, and the proposal will eventually come before the Laguna Niguel Planning Commission for approval.

It does not need to be approved by the City Council.

Planning Commission Chair Brian Fisk said the proposed condos will take up much less land than the ones that were demolished. He noted that the proposal does not involve building on the hillside.

“We have to rely on our professional consultants that work with the city to address those concerns and then our professional planning staff and the legal team that completes an environmental impact report,” Fisk said. “If we cannot rely on that, then I don’t know what we can rely on.”

Laguna Niguel, like much of Orange County, typically fields proposals for apartments or single family homes. Condominiums are less common, Fisk said.

“We’re looking at whether it’s suitable to have residential there again,” said Fisk, a retired city planner. “This meets the objectives of creating additional housing opportunities in the city, and it’s a for-sale product that we don’t have a lot of.”

As home prices soar amid a longstanding housing shortage, well-heeled suburbs like Laguna Niguel that have room to grow are facing increasing pressure to build.

A state law requires local governments to prepare a plan for new housing every eight years. Cities are assigned a specific number of new units under a complex formula that anticipates future housing needs.

Laguna Niguel’s requirement, approved by the city last year, is to zone for 1,207 new housing units.

Don Ware, who lives up the hill in Niguel Summit and worked for decades as a petroleum geologist, is skeptical that building below the buttress is safe. Even now, he said, the soil has slowly been creeping and settling toward the bottom of the hill.

The proposal includes a wall that would hold back the soil but isn’t intended to stabilize a landslide zone, Ware said.

“I don’t think it’s a good idea to put houses down below a landslide that was repaired with the understanding that there wouldn’t be any houses built there,” Ware said. “So the question for me is always: ‘Well, would you have repaired this slide differently if you knew you were going to do a development down below?’ I haven’t gotten a clear answer.”

Many south and coastal Orange County cities, including Laguna Niguel, have a long history of landslides.

In Laguna Beach, a 1978 landslide destroyed more than 20 homes in Bluebird Canyon. The same area slid again in 2005, destroying 17 homes.

Niguel Summit was built on at least six old landslide areas that were graded and buttressed.

A geological consultant told the developer that stability levels were “generally less than acceptable,” The Times reported in 1998, and that large parts of the parcel were “probably unstable.”

Rebuilding in landslide areas isn’t uncommon but must be done carefully to ensure the land remains stable, said Serge Tomassian, an Irvine attorney who has represented property owners following landslides.

Homebuyers should research landslide risk, but they are often caught unaware, Tomassian said.

Tomassian said cutting into a buttress is risky, and he would be surprised if the city approves such a plan.

Many nearby residents are worried that city officials may put the need for housing above safety concerns.

Nathan Smith bought a house in the Charter Terrace neighborhood, next to the proposed condo development, in 2013. He was attracted to the backyard view of the buttress, which looks more like a lush hillside than a strategy to keep landslides at bay.

Later, it became the first home he shared with his wife and the place where they are raising their two children.

But he is thinking about moving if the condos are approved.

It’s not that he or his neighbors are anti-development, he explained as he looked out over the hillside, still green despite the season’s lackluster rains, in early May.

It’s the fear that what happened 24 years ago could happen again.

“If this was a flat parcel with no tortured history,” he said, “it would be a different story.”",landslide at Via Estoril,landslide,downpour,Via Estoril,33.51975219289287,-117.72157862924621,2021-12-01 00:00:00,2022-02-28 23:59:59,0km,2022-01-14 23:59,1080hours,

Video by Josh Gray.)

Work to clear Lowell Point Road in Seward after a significant landslide Saturday evening hadn’t begun Sunday because of continuing safety concerns, the city reported.

The public is requested to stay clear of the road along Resurrection Bay for their own safety after a slide — estimated at 200-feet high and 300-feet wide — buried the road on Saturday night and has cut off access between Seward and the community of Lowell Point to the south. It is unknown how long the road will remain closed, the city said Sunday.

“It’s not stable still,” said City Clerk Brenda Ballou said. “Until we’re very, very positive that that’s a very stable environment, the work will not begin so the roads are still cut off.”

City officials met with local contractor Metco Alaska on Sunday morning to discuss debris removal, Ballou said. Metco Alaska has begun mobilizing equipment in preparation, but the work cannot begin until the area is safe.

“It may be over 40,000 cubic yards of debris that will have to be removed,” Ballou said.

While enormous boulders have already come down during the landslide, it’s hard to tell if the boulders above are stable or loose, Ballou said.

“It could get more or it could just settle down; We don’t know yet,” she said.

City officials continue to monitor and assess the situation from land and water and using drone footage, the city said in a written update Sunday morning.

After the slide occurred around 7:40 p.m. on Saturday, the City of Seward has declared an emergency, and officials started asking people to stay away from the area.

”We’re all pulling together. There’s no loss of life. And we’re super happy about that,” Seward City Manager Janette Bower said. She noted it could take a week to clear the road.

Seward police in an alert advised vessels in the vicinity of Resurrection Bay that the slide “generated a large floating debris field that includes a number of full sized trees.”

Photos and video of the slide showed a pileup of trees, dirt and debris that broke away from the steep slope above the road and crossed into the water below.

Josh Gray, 33, was driving out Lowell Point Road to camp for the night and meet a group of friends who’d gone halibut fishing earlier in the day.

They were stopped at a small rockslide, and watched with a few other cars as a loader chipped away at the pile. Then, some bigger rocks started tumbling down from the slope.

”Once the trees fell, it was like watching dominoes,” he said. “We’re all looking up at the hillside wondering how high up it’s going to go.”

The Saturday evening response drew Bower, the city police and fire chiefs and Seward’s public works director.

Those officials estimated that there were a couple hundred people — residents and weekend campers — stuck on the far side of the landslide, which cuts off 2 miles of dead-end road.

“Lowell Point has maybe 200-ish residents normally and we have a lot of visitors here though already,” Ballou said. “So it’s really unknown how many additional people might be affected.”

The water taxis are running between Miller’s landing and the Seward Harbor to help visitors and residents, Ballou said.

The taxis can run supplies, and a fire boat can respond to any emergencies, Bower said.

Anyone displaced by the landslide can seek shelter at Seward High School, city officials said. Shelter inquiries can be directed to Jason Bickling at 907-491-0803.

City officials described Lowell Point Road as critical infrastructure, and made note of “city wastewater and electric lines that run the length of that road.”

Gray and the group of friends accompanying him were left searching for a new spot to camp Saturday night. The worst part for them was that the slide left the halibut stuck on one side, and the fixings on the other.

”We’ve got the flour and the butter and the eggs and all the tartar sauce,” Gray said. “The menu’s kind of split.”

Keifang village lies along the 186-kilometre-long main road that connects Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram and Champhai, a town situated near the India-Myanmar border.

Vehicular movement along the road has come to a halt as a result of landslide and rock-fall.

The landslide has also led to disruptions in human movements as well with hundreds of commuters getting stuck at the Aizawl-Champhai road in Mizoram on May 4.

As per reports, efforts are ongoing to clear the road as soon as possible so that the movement of vehicles along this vital route resumes.

Notably, owing to its terrain, landslides happen to be a common phenomenon across the northeastern states with many getting affected every year as a result of it.

Earlier, in an unfortunate incident, three members of a family were buried alive in a heavy landslide in Arunachal Pradesh's Kurung Kumey district near the China border.

As per the reports, the victims were identified as 50-year-old Sariu Tongdang, his wife Sariu Yajik (48), and their eight-year-old son Sariu Takar.

Heavy and incessant rains were creating havoc and fear among the citizens of the state over the past few days.

Heavy and incessant rain on April 17 triggered landslides in different locations, especially in the district headquarters here, disrupting surface communication, water, and electricity supply.

Following the havoc, the district headquarters remained cut off from the rest of the state as the roads were blocked in several places between the old DC office and the mini secretariat in Malapu.

The county is drawing up a third set of plans to submit to the state Coastal Commission, which rejected previous permit applications in 2012 and again last February. But it’s far from certain those plans will be approved by the commission or what recourse homeowners have if an ocean-generated landslide takes their properties.

The threat of bluff failure is hardly a new problem for these homes above Strands Beach. The first boulder wall was built there in 1969 in preparation for construction of the residential subdivision, known as Niguel Shores, according to Coastal Commission documents.

But the issue is growing more critical there and elsewhere along the California coast, as the commission becomes increasingly adamant about preserving beaches and allowing “coastal migration” to carry the ocean and sands ever farther landward. The likelihood of homes, roads and other structures being lost to the rising sea is expected to become more common, as are tensions over how to address the the conflict.

“The commission is going to be facing harder and harder decisions,” said Sean Hecht, an environmental law professor at UCLA. “It’s really going to be a struggle over time.”

After the Coastal Act took effect in 1977, construction of beachfront armoring needed the blessing of the Coastal Commission, with such approval typically granted only to protect homes built prior to the Coastal Act. But even those seeking to safeguard older properties can find it increasingly difficult to get commission approval.

After a 1977 landslide took out six undeveloped lots in the Niguel Shores community, the commission gave the greenlight to reconstruction of the armoring there. After further damage, the commission approved additional fortification in 1986, although that work was never performed. But when the county returned with a rebuilding request in 2012, it was told to go back to the drawing board and it continues to search for an acceptable proposal nearly a decade later.

In a related case up the coast, at 11 Lagunita Drive in Laguna Beach, the commission in 2018 ordered the removal of a seawall it had approved 13 years earlier. The commission made its decision after determining that a massive remodeling of the home protected by that seawall constituted new development. The homeowner plans to appeal to the state Supreme Court after the commission prevailed in lower courts. If the seawall is removed, at least part of the $25 million home is expected to be taken down as well.

“Many residences and other structures located along the coast were built at a time when current scientific and engineering knowledge were lacking, and folks thought they could build and permit structures up to — and even beyond — the high-tide line without consequence,” said Richard Frank, a UC Davis environmental law professor.

“Now we know that the effects of climate change — especially sea level rise, and more frequent and intense coastal storms — are making many of those structures vulnerable and at risk. In seismically-active coastal areas like Southern California, that risk is exacerbated even more.”

Compounded by the Coastal Commission’s growing desire to retain beaches by allowing them to migrate landward, that situation has raised the stakes of what should be done about it — and Frank points to the Strands Beach dilemma as a prime example of the growing quandary of whether or not to further armor the coast.

Try again

When it rejected the county’s permit application to expand the boulder barrier at Strands Beach in 2012, the commission cited a number of concerns about the revetment, as the structure is known in engineering parlance. Those reservations included the amount of beach that would be lost with the enlarged approach, the durability and longevity of the structure, and mitigation for the environmental damage. One specific suggestion was to include a walkway at the top of the structure to replace public access lost to boulders on the beach.

Working closely with Coastal Commission staff, the county tried to address all of those issues in the application considered by the commission last year, with plan changes including a walkway that would connect with a similar walkway immediately downcoast. That downcoast beachfront structure and path, similar to what the county was proposing below Niguel Shores, were approved by the commission in 2004.

In its report to the commission, staff planners and geologists noted that about 62 homes in Niguel Shores sat on “a massive pre-historic landslide complex.” The report said possible alternatives — including a breakwater and sand replenishment — were investigated, but concluded “the proposed revetment is the least environmentally damaging feasible alternativeto protect the existing endangered structures.”

The commission disagreed, unanimously rejecting the proposal but offering no suggestions for an alternative. Commissioners said they were concerned the structure would result in a loss of public beach to benefit wealthy homeowners at taxpayer expense.

“All of us up here have spoken about the preciousness of our beaches and our terror at their loss,” Commissioner Donne Brownsey said at the Feb. 13 meeting. “(This) is what I consider a handful of homes compared to a large number of people who recreate on that beach and enjoy nature there. The public deserves better.”

An unusual facet of the situation is that the county — not the homeowners, as is usually the case — is responsible for maintaining the bluff, the result of a legal settlement dating to the early days of Niguel Shores development. That issue concerned commissioners, with taxpayers’ price tag for the new structure estimated at $10 million for construction and another $15 million in mitigation fees to be paid to the state.

California Deputy Attorney General Jamee Patterson told the commission last February she would explore other ways to obligate the association to be a signatory to the project. But if she’s made any headway, Patterson isn’t saying so publicly.

“My advice to (the commission) is protected by attorney-client privilege,” she told the Orange County Register this month.

Meanwhile, the county is developing a proposal that “involves only repairing the existing revetment within its previously approved, existing footprint and envelope,” according to county spokeswoman Kristi Bergstrom.

She said the county was monitoring the bluff “to the extent that it relates to the condition of the revetment” and if an immediate threat of significant collapse related to the revetment is detected, the county would apply for an emergency fortification. The commission has approved such emergency permits at San Onofre State Beach and Capistrano Beach in the past four years.

The Surfrider Foundation, which opposed last year’s proposal for the Strands Beach, has called the new plan “an improvement.” And homeowners are largely on board with the county’s approach.

“The Niguel Shores Community Association remains concerned about the deteriorated state of the existing revetment and is supportive of the county’s efforts to come to an agreement with the Coastal Commission,” said association attorney Fred Gaines.

Bergstrom anticipated a commission hearing on the proposed repairs would be held in 6 months to a year. Commission spokesperson Noaki Schwartz said her agency has reviewed the proposal and “didn’t identity any major red flags.”

“However, it still needs to go before the commissioners,” Schwartz said. “This approach is meant to be an interim solution while the agencies work on a longer term response to sea level rise and bluff stability issues.”

Insurance, lawsuits

Some experts say a bluff collapse at places like the Strands Beach may be only a matter of time, one that seawalls and boulders might, at best, forestall.

“You’re buying yourself time with armoring, but many ocean bluffs are eventually not going to hold up,” said UCLA’s Hecht. “When you’re buying above a revetment on an eroding bluff, you’re basically buying for an interim period, over the long term.”

The bluff-front homes in Niguel Shores are valued in the $7 million to $10 million range, according to Zillow.com. Typical homeowners insurance doesn’t cover damage or loss caused by landslides, according to Mark Sektnan of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, an insurance trade group.

For that, you’re going to need landslide insurance, which runs around $4 per $1,000 of coverage — or about $40,000 a year for a $10 million home, according to Money Geek’s extensive online insurance analysis. And if that landslide is caused by a flood or earthquake, you’ll probably need flood or earthquake insurance for reimbursement.

If the homes are damaged or destroyed by a landslide, it’s unclear whether the county or state could be held liable. But Hecht and veteran environmental attorney Mark Massara agreed the Coastal Commission is unlikely to lose such a lawsuit simply because it denied a permit.

Massara pointed to the courts’ support for the Coastal Commission so far in the 11 Lagunita Drive case. And while Hecht said homeowners could claim the failure to grant a permit was a “taking” of property in the event of a landslide, he called the legal strategy “a bit of a longshot.”

“The county is a different issue,” Hecht said. “The settlement is a contractural agreement and the county agreed to maintain the bluff. But then the county could argue its hands were tied by the Coastal Commission. There’s really not a clear answer.”

One thing seems fairly certain: Niguel Shores won’t be the last time you hear about the issue.

“I believe the Dana Point controversy is a harbinger of things to come, here in California and in coastal regions around the nation,” said UC Davis law professor Frank.",landslide at California,landslide,,California,36.37410569300005,-119.27022999999997,2020-12-01 00:00:00,2021-02-28 23:59:59,704km,2021-01-14 23:59,1080hours,

Brenda Ballou, a spokesperson for the city, told CNN a few hundred people live in Lowell Point, an unincorporated, heavily-visited tourist area on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage.

Marissa Beck, who owns a rental property in Seward, told CNN there are many cabins and rental houses in the area, and guests are now stuck in town or cannot get to their rentals. Many people are taking water taxis or their own boats to get to the other side of the slide.

No one was hurt when the slide occurred, Seward City Manager Janette Bower said in a Facebook post Saturday, and Ballou confirmed.

Nathaniel Caole was headed to walk his dogs on Saturday evening when he noticed a commotion on Lowell Road and pulled off to the side of the road to see what was happening. He noticed a boulder was blocking a part of the road, and cops were stopping traffic from passing by.

There were no injuries in the Saturday evening landslide about a half-mile (0.8 kilometer) south of downtown Seward, City Manager Janette Bower said.

A private contractor was handling the removal process and planned to use heavy equipment to clear the debris at the top first, working down to the roadway, Bower said. Part of the work has created additional slides within the original slide, slowing the process.

The slide measured 200 feet (61 meters) long by 300 feet (91 meters) wide and could take up to two weeks to clear, she estimated.

The slide has prevented about 200 residents and tourists from reaching Seward. There is a tiny community south of the slide, called Lowell Point, on the west side of Resurrection Bay, a 17-mile (27-kilometer) long body of water that leads to the Gulf of Alaska.

“There are a lot of cool things going on,” Bower said of efforts to make sure those stranded are able to get back and forth to Seward, including a water taxi and landing crafts. “They’re helping, so a lot of great community coming-together to get things done.”

Before the Seward landslide, traffic was stopped nearby because of falling rocks in the area. A police officer and a city loader were on scene to move rocks, some of which were the size of basketballs before one with a diameter of about 4 feet (1.22 meters) landed near the loader, said Josh Gray, who was with his wife, Nikki Holmes, watching sea lions float in the bay waiting for the all-clear.

They had driven about 125 miles (201 kilometers) south from Anchorage for a birthday party on the other side of the slide. They had just gone to a grocery store for ingredients for the batter to deep fry the fresh halibut their friends had caught earlier in the day. Their friends had made it through the rock fall area 15 minutes earlier.

Gray said all of a sudden, the loader began backing up, and he believes the driver “started to get a sense that things are still pretty active,” he said.

Gray estimated the loader was moving at maybe 4 mph (6 kph) but was able to clear the path “just in time. Things really picked up quickly,” he said just before the slope seemed to collapse before his eyes.

Seward has not had heavy rain recently or other normal conditions that would trigger a landslide, prompting the state geologist to visit the site and assess conditions, Bower said. Torrential downpours in December 2020 triggered landslides in Haines that killed two people.

“You can hear the whooshing of the rocks and earth and then as soon as the trees started falling, then we all knew it was like getting serious,” Gray said.

He looked up the slope and saw the fully grown evergreen trees falling “like dominoes” down the slope and toppling into Resurrection Bay.

“That was pretty alarming,” Gray said.

“My wife was smart to just run back to the car,” he said. “I was dumb enough to be there with phone, videoing it.”

He eventually got in the car and they retreated to the mainland, where they saw the scope of the slide.

“You know, our plans were minorly inconvenienced for the evening, but there’s a lot of residents that live out there and businesses that operate out there that are going to be impacted for a long time, so that’s pretty unfortunate,” he said.

Others also caught the dramatic slide on their phones. Besides posting it widely on social media, they also shared it with city officials.

“We’re really thankful for that video because that was able to confirm that there was no one in the slide,” Bower said.

About 14 women were looking for gold grains Thursday in a pit roughly 2 meters (6.5 feet) deep at a small and unauthorized traditional gold mine in a remote village of North Sumatra’s Mandailing Natal district when a landslide plunged down surrounding hills and buried them, said local police chief Marlon Rajagukguk.

A two-hour search and rescue operation managed to rescue two injured women and pulled the bodies of 12 other women from the rubble, Rajagukguk said.

He said authorities have closed illegal gold pits in the area, which was a main source of gold to be panned traditionally by villagers before Thursday’s landslide happened.

Informal mining operations are commonplace in Indonesia, providing a tenuous livelihood to thousands who labor in conditions with a high risk of serious injury or death.

Landslides, flooding and collapses of tunnels are just some of the hazards facing miners. Much of gold ore processing involves highly toxic mercury and cyanide and workers frequently use little or no protection.

The country’s last major mining-related accident occurred in February 2019 when a makeshift wooden structure in an illegal gold mine in North Sulawesi province collapsed due to shifting soil and the large number of mining holes. More than 40 people died, buried in the mine pit.

Alfonzo Caluna Jr., maintenance personnel of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) second engineering district, said he was mowing along the side of the highway in Barangay Poblacion around 8:40 a.m. on Monday when he saw a huge rock falling down the ground.

He quickly ran away and took refuge in a shanty at least 10 meters away, where he parked his motorcycle. “I saw a huge rock falling. It was followed by earth and later trees cascading down the highway,” Caluna said.

The landslide and rockfall blocked all traffic of vehicles entering the town of President Roxas and those going to the town of Antipas during Monday’s rush hour.

To fast track the clearing operation, the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (MDRRMO) in President Roxas used their heavy equipment and cleared the highway in less than an hour.

President Roxas town Mayor Jonathan Mahimpit said small landslides also happened in this particular stretch of highway in the previous week because of the torrential rains brought about by the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and intense thunderstorm.

He appealed to commuters to be vigilant and if possible, avoid passing through these areas during heavy downpour for their safety.

The local government has installed a signage to warn vehicles to be alert against possible rockfall and landslides along this particular stretch of the President Roxas-Antipas highway.

Unlicensed mines are common across mineral-rich Indonesia, with abandoned sites attracting locals who scrounge for leftover gold ore without using proper safety equipment.

A collapsed cliff in North Sumatra’s Mandailing Natal district struck Thursday afternoon, killing 12 women — aged 30 to 55 years old — who were digging for gold in an abandoned illegal mine.

“The cliff around the mine collapsed and buried the 12 women, killing them all,” local police chief Marlon Rajagukguk told AFP late Thursday, adding that the victims were not professional miners.

Two other women who worked alongside them managed to survive the disaster and ran back to the village to report the incident to the authorities.

It took hours for rescuers to evacuate the victims’ bodies as they were in a two-metre deep hole, which was filled with mud.

“Now all the bodies of the victims have been returned to their family,” Rajagukguk said.

Illegal gold mining is rampant in the Mandailing Natal, about 300 km (186 miles) south of the provincial capital of Medan, and several sites are abandoned by the operators.

Mining accidents are frequent across the archipelago due to landslides, especially during the monsoon summer months.

Last year six miners died when an illegal gold mine collapsed in Parigi Moutong on the island of Sulawesi.

In 2020, 11 miners in Sumatra were killed in a landslide triggered by heavy rains.

Excavators worked throughout the day Monday to start clearing the spruce trees, mud and boulders that tumbled down the hillside on Saturday, blocking Lowell Point’s only road access to Seward.

The large landslide left stranded tourists with tough choices and forced local Alaskans to figure out how to salvage their weekend getaways as business operators scrambled to accommodate them.

“It’s a massive impact financially,” said Chance Miller, owner of Miller’s Landing in Lowell Point. “And that’s just for right now.”

Listen to this story:

Miller’s business includes a campground, RV park and kayak rentals. And, until the landslide is cleared, there’s no way to get to it except by boat. Miller said his business set up a water taxi system to Seward within a few hours of the slide, which hit around 7:45 p.m. Saturday. It’s charging $25 each way. But, this weekend, it shuttled stranded customers back to Seward for free, eating into its overhead costs.

Seward city officials said it could take at least two weeks to reopen the narrow road to Lowell Point. A contractor for the city started clearing debris on Monday after the city decided there was no immediate risk of another large slide, said Seward City Clerk Brenda Ballou.

Ballou said the excavators worked “gingerly” to remove the 300-foot pile of trees, dirt and boulders from the road, which hugs the side of the mountains next to Resurrection Bay.

“They’re scooping earth, moving it, pushing it off,” she said from the road on Monday afternoon. “They’re trying to create a solid ramp access so that other equipment will be able to get up and they can mitigate some of the debris that’s above them.”

Meantime, about 40 cars are stuck on the other side of the slide in the Lowell Point area. That includes a couple that were part of a planned birthday celebration for 29-year-old Kipp Wilkinson.

After a day of fishing, around 7 p.m. Saturday, Wilkinson drove from Seward to Lowell Point to set up for the party. He made it past the slide area just in time.

“There were a couple boulders there that we drove past and then about 30 minutes later we got a call from our friends and said they weren’t going to make it,” he said.

They made the best of it that night.

“We had such a good time. We had all the beer. We had all the fresh fish. The only thing we didn’t have was tartar sauce,” he said.

Wilkinson said he took a water taxi to Seward on Sunday afternoon and hitched a ride back to Anchorage, where he lives.

Businesses operators, like Lynda Paquette who runs cabins for Angels Rest in Lowell Point, said out-of-state tourists also had to adapt quickly. One visiting family had to figure out a way to catch their flight the next day in Anchorage, said Paquette.

“They have abandoned their rental car here and checked out and then took the water taxi,” she said. Then, they spent hundreds of dollars on a taxi to drive them to Anchorage.

Paquette said some visitors who had stays booked for the next few days or weeks embraced the adventure of an extra water taxi ride. But others weren’t so happy and demanded refunds.

She said the landslide obstacle is another blow for the business after three tough years, beginning with large wildfires in 2019, and then the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I’m feeling more tired than resilient at this point,” she said.

Business owners say landslides are nothing new to the area, but they usually happen after heavy rains. This slide came seemingly without warning, except for a smaller slide that fell earlier in the day Saturday.

Scientists are trying to figure out the cause.

“The current thinking is just that with all the snowfall that we’ve had over the winter, and then over the last few days, the temperatures got very, very warm, and there’s a lot of snowmelt that’s gone on,” said De Anne Stevens, chief of the state’s geological engineering section.

Stevens, who is based in Fairbanks, has been analyzing photos of the slide and talking to scientists on the ground. She said there’s no immediate threat of another large slide.

But, she said, unfortunately for business owners — and recreators — landslides might happen more often in the area in the coming decades due to climate change.

“It’ll probably be a similar situation to what we’re seeing over a lot of parts of Alaska, where landslides are likely to occur, perhaps more frequently, largely, again, due to precipitation and warmer temperatures,” she said.
